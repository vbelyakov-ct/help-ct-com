* In the **Product Object **picklist, select the
desired Product__ __object.
* In the** Product Key Code** picklist, select the desired field.

3.  Allow Salesforce to create a field with the *Lookup* type when
prompted for the specified Product object.

The setup is complete. The field with the *Lookup* type will be
automatically created on the Product Image object to relate it with the
specified Product object.



Check the user profile permissions to make sure the newly created lookup
is available for all required users:
