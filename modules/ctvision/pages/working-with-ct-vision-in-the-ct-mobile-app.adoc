* Hints for the selected shelf will be displayed at the bottom of the
screen or in the pop-up.
For more information, refer to
link:vision-hint-field-reference.html[Vision Hint Field Reference].

Take a photo of the shelf.

The actual and planned number of photos, the number of errors, and the
actual number of the required report summaries are displayed on the
header of the screen.
When an indicator *(3)* is green, tap the *Photo* button *(2)* for the
selected shelf *(1)*.

report summary.

The final report summary will be displayed.

** In the *Pictures Total*, compare the planned and taken number of

number of photos is taken from the *Plan* field of the
https://help.customertimes.com/smart/project-ct-vision-lite-en/vision-object-field-reference[Vision
Object] record. Otherwise, the planned number is the sum of the values
from the *Plan* field
of the https://help.customertimes.com/smart/project-ct-vision-lite-en/vision-shelf-field-reference-2-9[Vision
Shelf] records.
** In the *Pictures Absence*, verify shelves, for which there is no
