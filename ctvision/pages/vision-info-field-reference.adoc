The *Vision Info* record type is responsible for viewing the product
details when
link:working-with-ct-vision-in-the-ct-mobile-app.html#h2_2072273480[the
clickable realogram is active].



When the mobile user taps the recognized photo on a shelf, the product
details with the product preview are displayed. The product previews are
stored in the same folder as the
link:product-image-field-reference.html[Product Images] records (if they
exist) on the server. 

* When
link:specifying-product-objects-and-fields.html#h2__1362989108[the
Product Code value] has been changed, Salesforce rebuilds the archive
with the *Product Images* records.
* CT Mobile downloads the archive during the first or full
synchronization.
* If the archive has been rebuilt, CT Mobile downloads it during the
next synchronization.
* If the archive is still the same since the first or full
synchronization, CT Mobile will not download it.
