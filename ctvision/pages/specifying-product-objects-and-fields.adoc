interact with product data in Salesforce. Specify the product fields to
send their values for processing and storing on the server.

== Cloud Token

To download all required CT Vision IR objects and apply the CT Vision IR
module logic, go
to https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/ct-mobile-control-panel-tools/a/h3_2011978[CT

Currently, the cloud token may be stored in two custom settings, and the
CT Vision IR retrieves it based on the combination of the CT Mobile
package version and the used CT Mobile app version. For more
information, refer to
