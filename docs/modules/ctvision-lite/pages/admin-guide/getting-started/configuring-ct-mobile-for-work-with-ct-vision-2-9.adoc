[NOTE]
====
Not in use in case of the integration with the CG Cloud solution.
====


Create the [.apiobject]#MobileId__c# field on the required [.object]#Vision# object in order to identify whether a record has been created on a mobile device or in Salesforce. Photos taken on a mobile device will be attached only to the records with the specified Mobile Id, and the taken photos will be stored on a mobile device up to 7 days.

== JSON Web Token

Photos taken in CT Mobile using the CT Vision Lite module are sent to the server. To connect to the server, the CT Mobile app sends that pair of the Salesforce Org Id in the 18-digit format and the valid cloud token to the server, and the server generates a JSON Web token.

* The JSON Web token is used each time the CT Mobile app connects to the server. If the JSON Web token is not received or is invalid, photos will not be sent to the server.
* The generated JSON Web Token lifetime is 1 year.
