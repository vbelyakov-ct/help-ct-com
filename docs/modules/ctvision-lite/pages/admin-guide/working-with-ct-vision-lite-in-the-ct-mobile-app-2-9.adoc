Otherwise, the planned number is the sum of the values from the *Plan* field of the xref:ref-guide/vision-settings-ref/vision-shelf-field-reference-2-9.adoc[Vision Shelf] records.
====
** In the *Pictures Absence*, verify shelves, for which there is no photo or the actual number of photos is less than the number specified in the *Plan* field of the xref:ref-guide/vision-settings-ref/vision-shelf-field-reference-2-9.adoc[Vision Shelf] record.
* Tap **Accept** to save the report.
