|First Full Synchronization a|
The first full synchronization must be launched after
link:logging-in.html[the authorization] of the current user.

The first full synchronization is intended to download the entire
database of the CT Mobile app, link:metadata-archive.html[metadata
components],
link:user-permissions-required-to-synchronize-objects-to-offline-work-with-functionalities.html[required
objects], and app settings from Salesforce to the mobile device.

* The first full synchronization may take a lot of time according to the
database size.



Steps:

. Metadata components are downloaded from the metadata archive.
. The current data model is created.
. Records of link:custom-settings.html[the custom settings&#44; custom
metadata types], link:managing-offline-objects.html[offline objects]
(based on SOQL filters), and objects, which are necessary for activated
link:mobile-application-modules.html[modules], are downloaded if a
record matches the conditions set in
link:related-list-filters.html[Related List Filters].
. The audit fields of the current *User* record are updated.

|Fast Synchronization a|
Fast synchronization is the preferred type for daily work with the CT
Mobile app. We recommend doing a fast synchronization once a day at the
beginning or end of the work day to maintain data consistency in the CT
Mobile app and Salesforce.

The fast synchronization is intended to align the records' main
information.

* Data changes, such as deletions, insertions, and updates of records,
will be sent from CT Mobile to Salesforce and vice versa.
* Enable link:ct-mobile-replication.html[CT Mobile Replication] if
territory coordinates have been altered to download all actual data on
the mobile device.



Steps:

. Records of link:custom-settings.html[the custom settings and custom
metadata types] are downloaded if the value in the
[.apiobject]#SystemModstamp# field is a date later than the date
of the last successful synchronization.
. The audit fields of the current *User* record are updated and then
audit fields and data changes in the application, such as deletions,
insertions, and updates, are sent to Salesforce.
. Data changes,
including https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/managing-offline-objects[offline
objects] (based on SOQL filters), are downloaded from Salesforce to the
mobile device.
.* If configured, the records of the specified objects mentioned in
the link:ct-mobile-replication.html[CT Mobile Replication] setting are
updated.

|Mixed Synchronization a|
We recommend running mixed synchronization in case of metadata changes,
e.g., updating validation rules, adding new lookup filters, etc.

The mixed synchronization is intended to align the records' main
information and update metadata since the date of the last successful
synchronization.

* Settings and records are downloaded without re-load of previously
downloaded records, which helps to reduce the sync time.



Steps:

. Metadata components are downloaded from the metadata archive.
. The structure (if it has been changed) and records of
https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/custom-settings[custom
settings&#44; custom metadata types],
https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/managing-offline-objects[offline
objects] (based on SOQL filters), and objects, which are necessary for
activated
https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/mobile-application-modules[modules],
are downloaded if the value in the[.apiobject]#SystemModstamp#
field is a date later than the date of the last successful
synchronization and a record matches the conditions in the
https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/related-list-filters[Related
List Filters].
. The audit fields of the current *User* record are updated and then
audit fields and data changes in the application, such as deletions,
insertions, and updates, are sent to Salesforce.
. Data changes are downloaded from Salesforce to the mobile device.
.* If configured, the records of the specified objects mentioned in
the link:ct-mobile-replication.html[CT Mobile Replication] setting are
updated.
