= Mobile Layouts

usage. To apply a mobile layout, follow the steps:

. Create link:mobile-layouts.html#h2__959581907[an inactive mobile
record type].

=== Creating the Mobile Record Type

In order to use the mobile layout in the CT Mobile app, it is necessary
to create an additional inactive record type for the existing active
record type.



To create the mobile record type:

. Go to *Setup → Object Manager →* the[.object]#Contact# object
*→ Record Types*.
. Click *New*.
. Enter the following parameters:
* In the *Existing Record Type* picklist, select the required record
type.
* In the *Record Type Label* field, type in the label, e.g., *Mobile
Record Type*.
* In the *Record Type Name* field, enter the API name in the following
format:[.apiobject]#Mobile_API-name of the record type#.

[NOTE] ==== To find out the API name, go to *Setup → Object
Manager →* object (e.g.,[.object]#Contact ==== ) *→ Record
Types →* select a record type → read the *Record Type Name* field. For
example, if the[.apiobject]#Contact# object has the *Doctor*
record type, create an inactive record type with the
[.apiobject]#Mobile_Doctor# API name.#
