= Transferring Settings from the Production Environment to Sandboxes

During the sandbox upgrade, all data is copied from the production
environment, including critical data for CT Mobile functionalities, such
as a cloud token and user profile IDs. If the profile IDs used do not
match the sandbox profile IDs, the sandbox does not have the necessary
settings, and there are no objects in the *Selected* column on the
link:ct-mobile-control-panel-offline-objects.html#h2_1468985423[CT
Mobile Control Panel: Offline
Objects]/link:ct-mobile-control-panel-offline-objects-new.html[CT Mobile
Control Panel 2.0: Offline Objects] tab.



This article helps you to make it easier to migrate settings from the
production environment to sandboxes.
