= Home Screen
:toc:

The Home Screen is the customizable starting page. By default, the customization is turned off and the Home Screen contains the logo, the  carousel of CLM presentations if available due to proper permission settings, and the calendar widget. You can add, remove, and resize the elements on the Home Screen for each profile separately.

TIP: Since CT Mobile 2.7, if there is no data for the added widget (e.g., CLM-presentations on the device or data for the reports), the widget icon is shown.

== Widgets on the Home Screen

[[h3_1361691321]]
=== Logo

A logo can be specified per profile. Select a profile on xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-general.adoc#h3_1354766135[CT Mobile Control Panel: General] / xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-user-interface-new.adoc#h3_1354766135[CT Mobile Control Panel 2.0: User Interface] and add a new logo.

[[h3_1292798904]]
=== Calendar

Starting from today, the widget shows activities of the two last and two next weeks.

* When a user taps a day, all _Activity_ records started on the selected day will be displayed in the left record list.
** Tap the filter icon to select the [.object]#Activity# object and display its records.
** Use arrows to view the _Activity_ records of the previous or next day.
** In the left records list of all activities of the selected day, the maximum number of records is 20.
+
TIP: In CT Mobile 2.5 the restriction has been removed.

** If xref:ios/admin-guide/start-finish-functionality.adoc[the Start/Finish functionality] is enabled, on activity is unfinished when the [.apiobject]#IsDone\__c# checkbox on the [.object]#Activity# object is not activated. If the user of the mobile device taps the *Finish* button
on the activity screen, the [.apiobject]#IsDone__c# checkbox will automatically be selected.
+
NOTE: The API names of the checkboxes on the [.object]#Activity# objects, for example, the [.apiobject]#IsDone\__c# field, should be specified (separated by a comma, without blank space) in the [.apiobject]#clm__ActivityDoneAPI__c# field on the xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/mobile-application-setup.adoc[Mobile Application Setup].

* Tap the icon to view and manage all activities of that day if xref:ios/getting-started/application-permission-settings.adoc[permission to create and
delete records is granted].
* To modify the *All activities per day* hint, create the _CalendarWidget_ link:https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.cl_edit.htm&type=5[custom label] with desired text label.

[[h3_1523913535]]
=== Carousel of CLM-presentations

Display the standard scenario and favorite custom scenarios of CLM presentations.

* In the Applications module, xref:ios/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/applications/index.adoc#h3_1557359819[add CLM-presentation(s) or scenario(s) to favorites]. The favorite CLM presentations will be displayed in the carousel.
* Scroll the carousel and tap on the CLM presentation to open it. In the presentation mode, use xref:ios/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/applications/gestures-in-clm-presentations.adoc[gestures] and xref:ios/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/applications/clm-presentation-controls.adoc[buttons].
* If the CLM presentation was republished, the red dot will appear next to its screenshot in the carousel and next to the _Applications_ label on the menu. Review the CLM presentation on your device.

[[h3_1761919763]]
=== Reports and Dashboards

NOTE: After creating or editing a dashboard or report, xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-tools-new.adoc#h3_1003786176[refresh the metadata archive] to ensure that reports and dashboards have been included correctly.

A mobile user can view dynamic report charts and dashboards:

* The charts and dashboards should be available for the mobile user.
* Since CT Mobile package version 4.8, we recommend creating dashboards and reports in Salesforce Lightning.
* Reports, which are used for creating offline dashboards, should be located in custom folders, not in default package folders. If a report is based on an offline dashboard, the dashboard also should be located in a custom folder.
* Objects used for chart building should be added to the list of the objects available offline (refer to xref:ios/admin-guide/managing-offline-objects/index.adoc[CT Mobile Control Panel: Managing Offline Objects] / xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-offline-objects-new.adoc[CT Mobile Control Panel 2.0: Offline Objects]).
+
On the Home screen, as well as on xref:ios/admin-guide/mobile-layouts/mobile-layouts-dashboards.adoc[the mobile layout], only offline reports and dashboards are available. When a dashboard collects data that is not stored in the mobile application, for example, xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/synchronization-launch/sync-logs.adoc[Sync Logs reports] or xref:ios/ct-presenter/about-ct-presenter/clm-scheme/clm-applicationstats.adoc[CLM-presentation statistics], the message «_No data to display_» will be shown on the Dashboard widget. A mobile user can view these dashboards online in xref:ios/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/dashboards.adoc[the Dashboards module] if the module was added to the main menu.
* To view or update dashboards and reports, launch a full synchronization. A valid cloud token is required.
* Using the *Fiscal year* criterion in filters and in reports and dashboards criteria is working as the *Calendar year*.

[[h2_396225247]]
== Status Indicator

The Status Indicator in the lower part of the home screen informs you about the data relevancy and if xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/index.adoc[the synchronization] is required. The Indicator begins to blink if you have updated some records or haven't performed the synchronization for a long time.

* Tap the Indicator to see the number of such records and the synchronization age.
* The Indicator has several statuses, which depend on the number of unsynchronized records and the date of the last synchronization.
* Attachments also influence the Status Indicator. Each attachment counts for 25 records.

The statuses and their conditions are listed in the following table:

[cols="^.^~,^.^~,^.^~",]
|===
|*Status* |*Number of Records* |*Synchronization Age, days*
