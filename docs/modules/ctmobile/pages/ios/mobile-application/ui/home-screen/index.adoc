= Home Screen

ifdef::ios,win,andr[]

The Home Screen is the customizable starting page. By default, the
customization is turned off and the Home Screen contains the logo, the
carousel of CLM presentations if available due to proper permission
settings, and the calendar widget. You can add, remove, and resize the
elements on the Home Screen for each profile separately.

Since CT Mobile 2.7, if there is no data for the added widget (e.g.,
CLM-presentations on the device or data for the reports), the widget
icon is shown.

ifndef::win[]

[[h3__1761919763]]
==== Reports and Dashboards

After creating or editing a dashboard or
report, link:ios/ct-mobile-control-panel-tools-new#h3_1003786176[refresh
the metadata archive] to ensure that reports and dashboards have been
included correctly.

A mobile user can view dynamic report charts and dashboards:

* The charts and dashboards should be available for the mobile user.
* Reports, which are used for creating offline dashboards, should be
located in custom folders, not in default package folders. If a report
is based on an offline dashboard, the dashboard also should be located
in a custom folder.
* Objects used for chart building should be added to the list of the
objects available offline (refer
to link:ios/managing-offline-objects[CT Mobile Control Panel: Managing
Offline
Objects]/link:ios/ct-mobile-control-panel-offline-objects-new[CT Mobile
Control Panel 2.0: Offline Objects]).
On the Home screen, as well as on
link:ios/mobile-layouts-dashboards[the mobile layout], only offline
reports and dashboards are available. When a dashboard collects data
that is not stored in the mobile application, for example,
link:ios/sync-logs[Sync Logs reports] or
link:ios/clm-applicationstats[CLM-presentation statistics], the message
«_No data to display_» will be shown on the Dashboard widget. A mobile
user can view these dashboards online in link:ios/dashboards[the
Dashboards module] if the module was added to the main menu.
* To view or update dashboards and reports, launch a full
synchronization. A valid cloud token is required.
* Using the *Fiscal year* criterion in filters and in reports and
dashboards criteria is working as the *Calendar year*.

[[h2__396225247]]
=== Status Indicator

The Status Indicator in the lower part of the home screen informs you
about the data relevancy and if link:ios/synchronization[the
synchronization] is required. The Indicator begins to blink if you have
updated some records or haven't performed the synchronization for a long
time.

* Tap the Indicator to see the number of such records and the
synchronization age.
* The Indicator has several statuses, which depend on the number of
unsynchronized records and the date of the last synchronization.
* Attachments also influence the Status Indicator. Each attachment
counts for 25 records.
