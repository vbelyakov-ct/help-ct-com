= Home Screen

//tag::ios,win,andr[]

The Home Screen is the customizable starting page. By default, the
customization is turned off and the Home Screen contains the logo, the
carousel of CLM presentations if available due to proper permission
settings, and the calendar widget. You can add, remove, and resize the
elements on the Home Screen for each profile separately.

Since CT Mobile 2.7, if there is no data for the added widget (e.g.,
CLM-presentations on the device or data for the reports), the widget
icon is shown.

Mobile Control Panel 2.0: User Interface] and add a new logo.

[[h3_1292798904]]
==== Calendar

Starting from today, the widget shows activities of the two last and two
next weeks.

When a user taps a day, all _Activity_ records started on the selected
day will be displayed in the left record list.

Tap the filter icon to select the _Activity_ object and display its
records.

ifndef::win,andr[]

Use arrows to view the _Activity_ records of the previous or next day.

[TIP] ==== In CT Mobile 2.5 the restriction has been removed.

ifndef::ios,andr[]

Аn icon with unfinished activities is shown in the upper right corner of
that day icon. An activity is unfinished when the
[.apiobject]#IsDone__c# checkbox on the _Activity_ object is
not activated.

ifndef::win[]

If xref:ios/admin-guide/start-finish-functionality.adoc[the Start/Finish functionality]
is enabled, on activity is unfinished when the
[.apiobject]#IsDone__c# checkbox on the _Activity_ object is
not activated. If the user of the mobile device taps the *Finish* button
on the activity screen, the [.apiobject]#IsDone__c# checkbox
will automatically be selected.
[NOTE] ==== The API names of the checkboxes on the _Activity_
objects, for example, the [.apiobject]#IsDone__c ==== field,
should be specified (separated by a comma, without blank space) in the
[.apiobject]#clm__ActivityDoneAPI__c# field on the xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/mobile-application-setup.adoc[Mobile Application Setup].#

Tap the icon to view and manage all activities of that day if
xref:ios/getting-started/application-permission-settings.adoc[permission to create and
delete records is granted].

To modify the *All activities per day* hint, create the _CalendarWidget_

[[h3_1523913535]]
==== Carousel of CLM-presentations

Display the standard scenario and favorite custom scenarios of CLM
presentations.

In the Applications module, xref:ios/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/applications/index.adoc#h3_1557359819[add

//tag::ios[]

[[h3_1761919763]]
==== Reports and Dashboards

After creating or editing a dashboard or
report, xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-tools-new.adoc#h3_1003786176[refresh
the metadata archive] to ensure that reports and dashboards have been
included correctly.

A mobile user can view dynamic report charts and dashboards:

* The charts and dashboards should be available for the mobile user.
* Reports, which are used for creating offline dashboards, should be
located in custom folders, not in default package folders. If a report
is based on an offline dashboard, the dashboard also should be located
in a custom folder.
* Objects used for chart building should be added to the list of the
objects available offline (refer
to xref:ios/admin-guide/managing-offline-objects/index.adoc[CT Mobile Control Panel: Managing
Offline
Objects] / xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-offline-objects-new.adoc[CT Mobile
Control Panel 2.0: Offline Objects]).
On the Home screen, as well as on
xref:ios/admin-guide/mobile-layouts/index.adoc-dashboards[the mobile layout], only offline
reports and dashboards are available. When a dashboard collects data
that is not stored in the mobile application, for example,
xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/synchronization-launch/sync-logs.adoc[Sync Logs reports] or
xref:ios/ct-presenter/about-ct-presenter/clm-scheme/clm-applicationstats.adoc[CLM-presentation statistics], the message
«_No data to display_» will be shown on the Dashboard widget. A mobile
user can view these dashboards online in xref:dashboards[the
Dashboards module] if the module was added to the main menu.
* To view or update dashboards and reports, launch a full
synchronization. A valid cloud token is required.
* Using the *Fiscal year* criterion in filters and in reports and
dashboards criteria is working as the *Calendar year*.

[[h2_396225247]]
=== Status Indicator

The Status Indicator in the lower part of the home screen informs you
about the data relevancy and if xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/index.adoc[the
synchronization] is required. The Indicator begins to blink if you have
updated some records or haven't performed the synchronization for a long
time.

* Tap the Indicator to see the number of such records and the
synchronization age.
* The Indicator has several statuses, which depend on the number of
unsynchronized records and the date of the last synchronization.
* Attachments also influence the Status Indicator. Each attachment
counts for 25 records.

The statuses and their conditions are listed in the following table:
