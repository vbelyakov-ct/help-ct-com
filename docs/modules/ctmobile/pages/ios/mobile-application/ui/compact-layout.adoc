= Compact Layout

https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=compact_layout_create.htm&type=5[The
compact layout] is a standard Salesforce functionality of Salesforce to
customize the record field display in the Salesforce mobile app and
Lightning Experience.



CT Mobile app uses compact layouts to form the title and subtitle of
records in the related lists, for example, in the *Calendar* and
*Routes* modules or on the *Errors* screen.



The record title is the value of the first field in a compact layout,
and the subtitle is the value of the second field in the compact layout,
except for:

* If the first field has no value, the title is generated by the value
in the field with the[.apiobject]#NameField=true# attribute.
* If a user has no access to fields of the assigned compact layout, the
title is generated by the value in the field with the
[.apiobject]#NameField=true# attribute.
* If the field with the[.apiobject]#NameField=true# attribute
has no value, the title is generated by its ID (Salesforce ID or
temporary ID in the application).

ifdef::ios[][NOTE] ==== Since version 2.9, 3 first fields
configured in compact layout will be displayed for each record in the
xref:calendar#h3_645629234[left menu] of the calendar. ====

Also, when a user taps on an *Activity* record on the calendar grid,
values of all fields, which have been added to the assigned compact
layout, will be displayed in the pop-up.
