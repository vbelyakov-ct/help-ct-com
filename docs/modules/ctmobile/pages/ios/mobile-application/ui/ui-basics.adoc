=== Main Menu

Main Menu is the list of objects and modules that are available for the
current user. The set of items in the list xref:ios/admin-guide/app-menu/index.adoc[can be
configured] in CT Mobile Control Panel.

* Tap a menu item to display the information on the main screen. Tapping
an object or module without the records list (e.g.,
xref:ios/mobile-application/ui/home-screen/index.adoc[Home] or xref:ios/mobile-application/application-settings/index.adoc[Settings])
will keep the main menu intact. Tapping an object or module with a
records list replaces the main menu with the records list.
* Display or hide the information by tapping the

icon.

If a module has only the main menu tooltips, the hamburger opens and
hides them. If an object has a list of records, tapping the hamburger
covers it with main menu tooltips.
* On a screen with an opened list of records, swipe the main menu icons
to the right to display the main menu tooltips. To go to the module or
object, click whether an icon or a tooltip.
