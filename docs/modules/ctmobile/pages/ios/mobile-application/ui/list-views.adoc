== List Views

The list views are pulled from Salesforce and available in:

* xref:ios/admin-guide/managing-offline-objects/index.adoc[Offline objects], such as [.object]#Accounts#, [.object]#Contacts#, [.object]#Opportunities#, etc.
* Reference fields, for example, for [.object]#Accounts#, [.object]#Contacts#, [.object]#Opportunities#, etc.
* The *Routes* module for the [.object]#Activity# objects.
* The *Nearby Accounts* module for [.object]#Account#, [.object]#Activity#, and [.object]#Contact# objects.
* The *Calendar* module for [.object]#Activity# and [.object]#Account# objects.
* The *Applications* module (if list views are created).

Some list views in CT Mobile do not come from Salesforce:

* *All{Object Name}*
* *Last viewed*
+
Values are displayed based on the link:https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfFieldRef.meta/sfFieldRef/salesforce_field_reference_RecentlyViewed.htm[Last Viewed Date] field retrieved from Salesforce. When a user opens a record in the CT Mobile app, the value in the *Last Viewed Date* field of this record is also changed, but this change will not be sent into Salesforce.
* *My{Object Name}*
+
Records available to the user according to link:https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.security_about_sharing_rules.htm&type=5[the sharing rules] will not be displayed.
* *This week*
* *Today*

If the object has no standard *Name* field, the column of the field with the [.apiobject]#nameField = true# attribute will be displayed. In other cases, the [.apiobject]#ID# column will be displayed.

List views are displayed above records in the left menu.

* The last selected list view of one of the offline objects or modules will be displayed the next time a user opens the corresponding offline object (including reference fields) or module.
* You can pin the desired list view (currently available only for the xref:ios/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/calendar/using-calendar.adoc#h3_632854949[Calendar] module).
* Records (regardless of case) are displayed in the list views if they match the filter criteria, for example, [.apiobject]#Record# and [.apiobject]#RECORD#. Next to the list view name the counter of records is displayed.
