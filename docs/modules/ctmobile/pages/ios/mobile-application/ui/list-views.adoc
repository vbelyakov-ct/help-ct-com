=== List Views

The list views are pulled from Salesforce and available in:

link:ios/managing-offline-objects[Offline objects], such as
[.object]#Accounts#,[.object]#Contacts#,
[.object]#Opportunities#, etc.

Reference fields, for example, for[.object]#Accounts#,
[.object]#Contacts#,[.object]#Opportunities#, etc.

The ​**Routes** module for the[.object]#Activity# objects.

The *Nearby Accounts* module for[.object]#Account#,
[.object]#Activity#, and[.object]#Contact# objects.

​The *Calendar* module for[.object]#Activity# and
[.object]#Account# objects.

ifndef::kotlin[]

The *Applications* module (if list views are created).



Some list views in CT Mobile do not come from Salesforce:

* All{Object Name}
* Last viewed

Values are displayed based on the
https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfFieldRef.meta/sfFieldRef/salesforce_field_reference_RecentlyViewed.htm[Last
Viewed Date] field retrieved from Salesforce. When a user opens a record
in the CT Mobile app, the value in the *Last Viewed Date* field of this
record is also changed, but this change will not be sent into
Salesforce.

ifdef::ios[]If the object has no standard *Name* field, the column
of the field with the [.apiobject]#nameField = true# attribute
will be displayed. In other cases, the [.apiobject]#ID# column
will be displayed.



List views are displayed above records in the left menu.

ifdef::ios[]

The last selected list view of one of the offline objects or modules
will be displayed the next time a user opens the corresponding offline
object (including reference fields) or module.

You can pin the desired list view (currently available only for the
link:ios/using-calendar#h3__632854949[Calendar] module).

ifdef::win[]

The last selected list view of one of the offline objects or modules
will be displayed the next time a user opens the corresponding offline
object (including reference fields) or module. The logic does not affect
the list view display in the *Calendar* module.

After the first synchronization, the *Accounts* tab will be displayed in
the Calendar module. Then, the last selected list view will be displayed
the next time a user opens the *Calendar* module.

Records (regardless of case) are displayed in the list views if they
match the filter criteria, for example,[.apiobject]#Record# and
[.apiobject]#RECORD#. Next to the list view name the counter of
records is displayed. ifndef::ios[][NOTE] ==== The counter
of records next to the list view name is only displayed if there are
fewer than 500 records per an object downloaded on the device.
Otherwise, the counter is not shown. ====
