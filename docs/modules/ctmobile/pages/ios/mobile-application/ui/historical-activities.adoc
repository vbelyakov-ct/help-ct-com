= Historical Activities

If the previous activities are related to the current one, view
information on previous activities accessing it from the current
_Activity_ record screen.



The following rules are used as search criteria for historical data:

* The same record type of _Activity_ records.
* The values of the required fields that were filled out on
xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/mobile-mini-layout-settings.adoc[the mini layout] are the same.
* The start date of the historical activity is prior to that of the
currently open one.

For the
standard [.object]#Event# and [.object]#Task# objects,
the historical activity will be searched following all the criteria
listed above, as well as the values in
the [.apiobject]#WhoId# and [.apiobject]#WhatId# fields
if they are specified. [TIP] ==== Use the
[.apiobject]#clm__ActivityDoneAPI__c ==== attribute of
xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/mobile-application-setup.adoc[Mobile Application Setup] as a
checkbox field to indicate that the activity has been completed. It can
help with a possible cut-off of canceled or unfinished activities in the
past.#
