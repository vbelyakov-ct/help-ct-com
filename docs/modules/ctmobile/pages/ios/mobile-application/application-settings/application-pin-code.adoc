ifdef::ios[]

Use a passcode to log in to the CT Mobile app and to call the
application if it was collapsed or closed.



The passcode can be set up only for the current session, and it is
stored locally on a mobile device. It means that you should set up a
passcode anytime you link:ios/log-out[log out] of the mobile
application.
