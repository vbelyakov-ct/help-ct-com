= Full Synchronization

To run full synchronization, long tap the *Sync* button in the top right corner of the xref:ios/mobile-application/ui/home-screen/index.adoc[Home Screen] and select *Full synchronization* from the picklist.

NOTE: Due to the link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_background[iOS platform limitations], do not collapse the application and do not turn off the screen during the first or full synchronization.

* The full synchronization is triggered when you run your first synchronization.
* During the full synchronization except for the first full synchronization, the application is locked.
* The full synchronization process will be interrupted in case of errors.

== Sync Steps

. Data changes in the application such as deletions, insertions, and updates are sent to Salesforce.
+
The step is skipped during the first full synchronization because the database is empty.
. The changes in xref:ios/ct-presenter/about-ct-presenter/clm-scheme/clm-user/index.adoc[the audit fields] of the current user record are sent to Salesforce.
+
NOTE: The change of the [.apiobject]#clm\__LastSyncDate__c# field will be updated only if the previous synchronization was successful, but has been interrupted before the field sync date was updated.
. xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/metadata-archive/index.adoc[Metadata components] are downloaded.
+
Metadata components are downloaded from ZIP archive(s) or directly using administrator credentials depending on xref:ios/getting-started/installing-ct-mobile-package/ct-mobile-managed-package-update-to-v-3-54.adoc[the CT Mobile package version]. The cloud token should be valid to retrieve components from the ZIP archive(s) (refer to xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-tools/index.adoc#h3_2011978[CT Mobile Control Panel: Tools] / xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-tools-new.adoc#h2_2011978[CT Mobile Control Panel 2.0: Tools]). The synchronization process can proceed without a valid cloud token or administrator credentials, and in that case, xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/validation.adoc[validation rules], offline reports, and some operators in formulas might not operate properly.
. The current data model:
* is created in case of *the first full synchronization*.
* is replaced by the newly updated in case of *full synchronization*.
. Records of xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/index.adoc[the custom settings, custom metadata types], xref:ios/admin-guide/managing-offline-objects/index.adoc[offline objects], and objects, which are necessary for activated xref:ios/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/index.adoc[modules], are downloaded if a record matches the conditions set in xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/related-list-filters.adoc[related list filters].
. xref:ios/ct-presenter/about-ct-presenter/clm-scheme/clm-user/index.adoc[The audit fields] of the current user record are updated:
+
NOTE: The [.apiobject]#clm\__LastSyncDate__c# field will be updated only if the first full or full synchronization was successful. This field shows that the actual information is downloaded on the device.
