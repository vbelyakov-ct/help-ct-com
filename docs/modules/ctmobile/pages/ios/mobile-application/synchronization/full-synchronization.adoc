ifdef::ios[][NOTE] ==== Due to the
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_background[iOS
platform limitations], do not collapse the application and do not turn
off the screen during the first or full synchronization.  ====

* The full synchronization is triggered when you run your first
synchronization.
* During the full synchronization except for the first full
synchronization, the application is locked.
* The full synchronization process will be interrupted in case of
errors.

=== Sync Steps

. Data changes in the application such as deletions, insertions, and
updates are sent to Salesforce.
The step is skipped during the first full synchronization because the
database is empty.
. The changes in link:ios/clm-user[the audit fields] of the current
user record are sent to Salesforce.

[NOTE] ==== The change of the
[.apiobject]#clm__LastSyncDate__c ==== field will be
updated only if the previous synchronization was successful, but has
been interrupted before the field sync date was updated. #
. link:ios/metadata-archive[Metadata components] are downloaded.
ifdef::ios,win[]Metadata components are downloaded from ZIP
archive(s) or directly using administrator credentials depending
on link:ios/ct-mobile-managed-package-update-to-v-3-54[the CT Mobile
package version]. The cloud token should be valid to retrieve components
from the ZIP archive(s) (refer
to link:ios/ct-mobile-control-panel-tools#h3_2011978[CT Mobile Control
Panel: Tools]/link:ios/ct-mobile-control-panel-tools-new#h2_2011978[CT
Mobile Control Panel 2.0: Tools]). The synchronization process can
proceed without a valid cloud token or administrator credentials, and in
that case, link:ios/validation[validation rules], offline reports, and
some operators in formulas might not operate properly.
ifdef::andr[]Metadata components are downloaded using valid
administrator credentials. The synchronization process can proceed
without valid administrator credentials,
but link:ios/validation[validation rules] offline reports, and some
operators in formulas might not operate properly.

record matches the conditions set in
link:ios/related-list-filters[related list filters].
