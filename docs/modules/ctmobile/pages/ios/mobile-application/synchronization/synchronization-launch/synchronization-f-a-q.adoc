[[h2_1632467576]]
=== Synchronization Modes

[[h3_2097853915]]
==== When to launch the full synchronization?

The full synchronization should be launched:

* to download the current user database (data, metadata, app settings):
** when a mobile user launches the first synchronization after
xref:ios/getting-started/logging-in/index.adoc[logging in];
** when the new version of the CT Mobile app is installed.
* to send data changes (deletions, insertions, and updates of records)
from the CT Mobile app to Salesforce and ​completely replace the current
user database (data, metadata, app settings) if changes were made on
the xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/index.adoc[CT Mobile Control
Panel] / xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/index.adoc[CT Mobile Control Panel
2.0].



Important notes:

* In case of any errors, the full synchronization is interrupted.
* The CT Mobile app is locked during the full synchronization except for
the first full synchronization.
* The sync process may take a lot of time, depending on the database
size.



For more information, read xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/full-synchronization.adoc[the Full
Synchronization article].



Go back to xref:synchronization-f-a-q#F.A.Q.list[the F.A.Q. list].

[[h3_965238074]]
==== When to launch the fast synchronization?

The fast synchronization is intended to:

* send data change (deletions, insertions, and updates of records) from
the CT Mobile app to Salesforce, including changes in the field
attributes;
* download data changes (deletions, insertions, and updates of records)
from Salesforce to the device, including changes in the field
attributes;
* update CLM presentations in case of
xref:ios/ct-presenter/publishing-clm-presentations.adoc[republishing]. The CT Mobile app
compares the current version of the CLM presentation with the one
previously saved. If any discrepancies are found, slides and
attachments, which were updated after the last synchronization, will be
loaded.
** In case of the future date in the *Forced Load Date* field
xref:ios/ct-presenter/about-ct-presenter/clm-scheme/clm-application.adoc[on the CLM presentation record], the CT mobile
app asks the current user to download the CLM presentation or not.
** In the case of the past date or an empty value in the *Forced Load
Date* field, the CLM presentation will be downloaded.



Important notes:

In the case of record errors, the fast synchronization continues. Errors
could be managed on xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/errors-screen.adoc[the Errors screen].

The CT Mobile app is not locked during the fast synchronization.

[[h3_1232469734]]
==== When does the mixed synchronization automatically launch instead of the fast synchronization?

The mixed synchronization launches when:

* the date of the last successful synchronization on the
xref:ios/ct-presenter/about-ct-presenter/clm-scheme/clm-user/index.adoc[current user's record] is earlier than the date of
the last metadata change in the
[.apiobject]#clm__MetadataLastModifiedDate__c# field of
the xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/mobile-application-setup.adoc[Mobile Application Setup] record
for the current user's profile (if this record exists) or for the
current user's Salesforce organization;
* the date of the last metadata change is not set in the
[.apiobject]#clm__MetadataLastModifiedDate__c# field of
the xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/mobile-application-setup.adoc[Mobile Application Setup] record.



The mixed synchronization is intended to:

* download settings and records without re-load of previously downloaded
records, which helps to reduce the sync time.
* download xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/metadata-archive/index.adoc[metadata] changes in ZIP
archive(s) and via API according to the current user profile;
* send data changes (deletions, insertions, and updates of records) from
the CT Mobile app to Salesforce;
* download data changes (deletions, insertions, and updates of records)
from Salesforce to the device;
* update CLM presentations in case of
xref:ios/ct-presenter/publishing-clm-presentations.adoc[republishing]. The CT Mobile app
compares the current version of the CLM presentation with the one
previously saved. If any discrepancies are found, slides and
attachments, which were updated after the last synchronization, will be
loaded.
** In case of the future date in the *Forced Load Date* field
xref:ios/ct-presenter/about-ct-presenter/clm-scheme/clm-application.adoc[on the CLM presentation record], the CT mobile
app asks the current user to download the CLM presentation or not.
** In the case of the past date or an empty value in the *Forced Load
Date* field, the CLM presentation will be downloaded.



Important notes:

The date of the last metadata change will be updated each time you make
a change on xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/index.adoc[CT Mobile Control
Panel] / xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/index.adoc[CT Mobile Control Panel
2.0].

You can manually update the date for the corresponding profile by
editing the
[.apiobject]#clm__MetadataLastModifiedDate__c# field of
the xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/mobile-application-setup.adoc[Mobile Application Setup] record
for the current user's profile (if this record exists) or for the
current user's Salesforce organization.

In the case of record errors, the mixed synchronization continues.
Errors could be managed on xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/errors-screen.adoc[the Errors screen];

The CT Mobile app is not locked during the mixed synchronization;

ifndef::win,andr[]

The sync process may include xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/ct-mobile-replication.adoc[CT Mobile
Replication];

The sync process may include the xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/sync-recovery.adoc[Sync Recovery]
functionality;

To refresh metadata in the ZIP archive

//tag::ios[]

[[h3_115254474]]
==== When to use the quick record synchronization?

The common use case is to download changes for a particular record. For
example, xref:ios/ct-presenter/the-remote-detailing-functionality/remote-detailing-launch/remote-detailing-launch-the-ct-mobile-app.adoc[to download
the invite link] for the Remote Detailing functionality or update the
record related lists.



Go back to xref:synchronization-f-a-q#F.A.Q.list[the F.A.Q. list].

[[h3_371527703]]
==== When to use the Sync Recovery functionality?

The Sync Recovery functionality allows sending records with any errors
to Salesforce. Records can be sent as usual or as the JSON file for
post-processing by the administrator. The errors will not be erased from
the sync logs and, hence, from the reports.



For more information, read xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/sync-recovery.adoc[the Sync Recovery
article]. Error types are listed in
https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_calls_concepts_core_data_objects.htm[the
Salesforce Developer Guide article].



Go back to xref:synchronization-f-a-q#F.A.Q.list[the F.A.Q. list].

[[h3_2034589294]]
==== When to use CT Mobile Replication?

During the fast synchronization, only records with the modified
[.apiobject]#SystemModStamp# field will be downloaded. However,
if you changed
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=security_about_sharing_rules.htm&type=5[sharing
rules] (via organization-wide defaults or per each record), the value in
the [.apiobject]#SystemModStamp# field is not modified. In this
case, xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/ct-mobile-replication.adoc[create a CT Mobile Replication
setting] to keep data up to date on the device. The corresponding
records will be downloaded and records, which are no longer available,
will be hidden.



The CT Mobile Replication example is available
xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-replication-use-cases-and-steps.adoc[here].



Go back to xref:synchronization-f-a-q#F.A.Q.list[the F.A.Q. list].

//tag::ios,win[]

[[h3_2143775923]]
==== How to know that the synchronization is successful?

If the synchronization was successful, the notification
*«Synchronization completed. Duration: HH:MM:SS.»* If an error occurred
during the sync process, a notification appears with the text of the
error, and the user should close it.

ifndef::win[]

To find out the time and date of the last successful synchronization,
and to see the number of records waiting to be sent to Salesforce, tap
on xref:ios/mobile-application/ui/home-screen/index.adoc#h2_396225247[the status indicator] at the
bottom of the screen.

=== Synchronization Details

[[h3_11590014]]
==== What are the synchronization statuses?

Depending on the selected debug level, the sync log record with the
corresponding status will be saved for synchronization and all performed
operations, except for Geo Tracing and Geolocation. For more
information, read xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/synchronization-launch/sync-log.adoc[the Sync Log article].



*Success*

* full synchronization is complete;
* fast/mixed synchronization is complete (with or without the Sync
Recovery functionality and CT Mobile Replication);
* completed operation.



*Partially Success*

* fast/mixed synchronization if there are errors, for example, if the
required field is blank or the start date is later than the end date
(with or without the Sync Recovery functionality and CT Mobile
Replication);
* operation if some records are not successfully created, updated,
deleted, or inserted.



*Failed*

* the internet connection has been lost;
* ​the device screen has been turned off;
* the device has been turned off;
* any errors during first/full synchronization.
* for operation if all records have errors due to which they were not
created, updated, deleted, or inserted.



Go back to xref:synchronization-f-a-q#F.A.Q.list[the F.A.Q. list].

[[h3_1530730493]]
==== Where are the synchronization statistics stored?

The xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/synchronization-launch/sync-log.adoc[Sync Log] object is intended to store logs for
each performed synchronization.

* the main Sync log record with the type of synchronization;
* sync log records for each operation performed during the sync process.



The Sync Log record may include attachments:

the [.apiobject]#SyncSingle.log# file with all operations for
the first, full, fast, mixed, and quick record synchronization.

the [.apiobject]#sync.log# file for the
xref:ios/mobile-application/application-settings/send-application-data-dump.adoc#SendApplicationDataDump-SpecifyDatatoSend[Sync
Log History] operation.

the [.apiobject]#Documents.zip# for the Export Data operation;

ifndef::andr,win[]

In the case of Sync Recovery, the
[.apiobject]#RecoveryData_2019-12-06 10:53:16.log# file for
the create, update, or insert operation along with the JSON file.



For more information, read xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/synchronization-launch/sync-logs.adoc[the Sync Logs article].



Go back to xref:synchronization-f-a-q#F.A.Q.list[the F.A.Q. list].

//tag::ios[]

[[h3_666651666]]
==== How many API requests are used within the first full synchronization?

A single API request contains from 10 to 2 000 records. All requested
data volume is divided into batches depending on the number of fields
and field types of the object. Also,
xref:ios/ct-presenter/about-ct-presenter/clm-scheme/attachments-and-files.adoc[attachments] can be downloaded one at a
time.

* Approximately, the CT Mobile app is loading around 1 000 records per
second, assuming the objects do not have fields with the «heavy» type,
such as *Text Area (Long)*, *Text Area (Rich)*, etc.
* To view the number of API requests, perform the synchronization, go to
*Setup → Company Settings → Company Information*, and check the *API
Requests, Last 24 Hours* field.

[[h2_2101954030]]
=== Metadata Components and Related Error Handling

[[h3_831436350]]
==== What components are included in the metadata archive?

The list of components is available
xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/metadata-archive/index.adoc#h2_1854953360[here]. Also, the metadata
archive includes all offline objects that were specified on the
xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-offline-objects.adoc[CT Mobile Control
Panel: Offline
Objects] / xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-offline-objects-new.adoc[CT Mobile
Control Panel 2.0: Offline Objects].



Go back to xref:synchronization-f-a-q#F.A.Q.list[the F.A.Q. list].

[[h3_317222557]]
==== How often should you rebuild the metadata archive?

We recommend enabling xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/index.adoc[a metadata checker] and
xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/index.adoc#h3_1645525423[setting a schedule] for a
metadata checker according to your business processes, such as the
frequency of updating settings on the CT Mobile Control Panel tabs,
changing lookup filters, creating custom labels, managing validation
rules, etc.



Go back to xref:synchronization-f-a-q#F.A.Q.list[the F.A.Q. list].

[[h3_335611687]]
==== Why were not the up-to-date metadata components downloaded during the full or mixed synchronization?

The metadata archive has not been created or updated. Some functionality
may incorrectly work, for example, xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/validation.adoc[offline
validation rules].

. Check xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-tools/index.adoc#h3_2011978[the cloud
token] (refer to xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-tools/index.adoc#h3_2011978[CT
Mobile Control Panel:
Tools] / xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-tools-new.adoc#h2_2011978[CT Mobile
Control Panel 2.0: Tools]) is valid.
. Create a ZIP archive or refresh metadata in the ZIP archive. We
recommend enabling xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/index.adoc[a metadata checker]. Also,
it is possible xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/index.adoc#h3_1645525423[to set a
schedule] for a metadata checker or
xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/index.adoc#h2_1657467916[manually create/update] the
metadata archive.

[[h3_439788848]]
==== Why is the new translation for an object or a field not displayed in the CT Mobile app?

https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.adding_and_editing_translated_languages.htm&type=5[Translation
Workbench] is used to maintain translated values for metadata and data
labels in Salesforce org, for example, to translate fields, objects,
related lists, etc.

* If the translation is absent, the label will be displayed.
* If the translation has been added, check the metadata archive is
created or updated. We recommend enabling xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/index.adoc[a
metadata checker]. Also, it is possible
xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/index.adoc#h3_1645525423[to set a schedule] for a
metadata checker or xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/index.adoc#h2_1657467916[manually

[[h3_1646090375]]
==== The lookup filter has been changed. Why has not it been downloaded to the device?

The lookup filters are the components of the metadata archive. If you
created or changed the lookup filter, it is necessary to rebuild
xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/metadata-archive/index.adoc[a metadata archive]. We recommend enabling
xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/index.adoc[a metadata checker]. Also, it is possible
xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/index.adoc#h3_1645525423[to set a schedule] for a
metadata checker or xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/index.adoc#h2_1657467916[manually
create/update] the metadata archive.



Go back to xref:synchronization-f-a-q#F.A.Q.list[the F.A.Q. list].

[[h3_98900833]]
==== The metadata checker has been enabled. Why are not the up-to-date metadata components downloaded to the device?

Please note that the creation of the metadata archive may take some
time.



Follow steps:

. Go to the *Setup →* enter _Apex Jobs_ in the *Quick Find* box → click
the
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=code_apex_job.htm&type=5[Apex
Jobs] page.
. Check that there are no errors in the classes:
*[.apiobject]#Schedule_LastModifiledDate# is used to build
a metadata archive. If the status of the Apex class is *Failed*, then
the metadata archive has not been compiled. Refresh the cloud token
value and re-build the archive;
*[.apiobject]#Schedule_CheckRetrieveStatus# is used to
retrieve a metadata archive. If the status of the Apex class is
*Aborted*, then the metadata archive has not been compiled. The class
will request the archive until the archive is compiled, and then the
class status will change to *Completed*.

[[h3_2090909248]]
==== What to do if the sync process has stopped due to missing the CT Mobile license?

To use the CT Mobile app, assign the CT Mobile license to the mobile
users.



Go back to xref:synchronization-f-a-q#F.A.Q.list[the F.A.Q. list].

[[h3_755626042]]
==== What to do if the sync process has stopped due to an inactive organization error?

This error occurs when the Salesforce organization is no longer active.
Disconnect then reconnect from Salesforce.



Go back to xref:synchronization-f-a-q#F.A.Q.list[the F.A.Q. list].

[[h3_2051887665]]
==== What to do if synchronization takes too long?

The duration of the sync process depends on:

* the internet connection. Check
xref:ios/ct-mobile-solution/technical-requirements-for-devices-and-network.adoc#h2_1498128754[the
requirements for the connection].
* amount of data. To avoid the synchronization of the large data,
xref:ios/admin-guide/managing-offline-objects/index.adoc[customize the criteria] to download
desired records of offline objects.

* amount of modified components (objects, fields, layouts) or changes
provided on the xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/index.adoc[CT Mobile Control
Panel] / xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/index.adoc[CT Mobile Control Panel
2.0]. In this case, mixed synchronization is in progress instead of fast
synchronization, and the sync process takes more time.



Go back to xref:synchronization-f-a-q#F.A.Q.list[the F.A.Q. list].

[[h3_381741377]]
==== What to do if the INVALID_TYPE error occurs?

The [.apiobject]#INVALID_TYPE# error occurs if you haven't
access to a field because of revoked access in Salesforce. When you
perform fast synchronization, the system cannot retrieve records of
objects because the current user has no access to several object fields.



To avoid this issue, we recommend this sequence of steps:

. Users perform fast synchronization.
. The administrator makes changes to the object model in Salesforce
(sharing rules, adding and removing fields, changing a profile for a
user).
. Users perform a full synchronization.



Go back to xref:synchronization-f-a-q#F.A.Q.list[the F.A.Q. list].

[[h3_1079670190]]
==== What to do if the UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION error occurs?

The [.apiobject]#UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION# error occurs due to
either an incorrect setting or a Salesforce error.

* Identify the query where the error occurs during synchronization, and
check it in https://workbench.developerforce.com/login.php[Workbench].
* If the queries are correct, contact Salesforce and report the error.



Go back to xref:synchronization-f-a-q#F.A.Q.list[the F.A.Q. list].

[[h3_1189028288]]
==== What to do if the MALFORMED_QUERY error occurs?

The [.apiobject]#MALFORMED_QUERY# error occurs when the SOQL
filter is incorrectly specified for the offline object. Check the
xref:ios/admin-guide/managing-offline-objects/index.adoc[SOQL query] in the error message.



Go back to xref:synchronization-f-a-q#F.A.Q.list[the F.A.Q. list].

[[h3_1710675976]]
==== What to do if the INVALID_FILTER_QUERY_OPERATOR: invalid ID field occurs?

The [.apiobject]#INVALID_FILTER_QUERY_OPERATOR:
invalid ID field# error is due to a temporary mobile record ID being
inserted into xref:ios/admin-guide/managing-offline-objects/reference-fields.adoc[the reference field] when the
query is formed. Check the custom logic that inserts the temporary ID ​in
the field.

[[h2_1173330258]]
=== Synchronization Modes

[[h3_2097853915]]
==== When to launch the full synchronization?

The first full synchronization must be launched after
https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-android-2-0-en/logging-in[the
authorization] of the current user in order to download the current user
database (data, metadata, app settings).

The sync process may take a lot of time, depending on the database size.

[[h3_965238074]]
==== When to launch the fast synchronization?

Fast synchronization is the preferred type for daily work with the CT
Mobile app. We recommend doing a fast synchronization once a day at the
beginning or end of the work day to maintain data consistency in the CT
Mobile app and Salesforce.

The sync process may include xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/ct-mobile-replication.adoc[CT Mobile
Replication].

[[h3_1232469734]]
==== When to launch the mixed synchronization?

The mixed synchronization is intended to align the records' main
information and update metadata since the date of the last successful
synchronization.

The sync process may include xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/ct-mobile-replication.adoc[CT Mobile
Replication].



We recommend running mixed synchronization in case of metadata changes,
for example:

* adding lookup filters;
* updating layouts for records;
* changing validation rules;
* etc.

[[h3_2034589294]]
==== When to use CT Mobile Replication?

We recommend using CT Mobile Replication when you changed
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=security_about_sharing_rules.htm&type=5[sharing
rules] (via organization-wide defaults or per each record). In this
case, xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/ct-mobile-replication.adoc[create a CT Mobile Replication
setting] to keep data up to date on the device. The corresponding
records will be downloaded and records, which are no longer available,
will be hidden.

[[h2_1282672032]]
==== What synchronization mode should I use when updating CT Mobile?

When updating the CT Mobile app, we recommend:

. Run the fast synchronization.
. Remove the previous version of the CT Mobile app from the mobile
device.

[TIP] ==== When we release the new version of CT Mobile, we
check its compatibility with the previous version and let you know if
removing the CT Mobile app can be skipped. In this case, run the fast
synchronization, install a new version of CT Mobile on top of an
existing one, and then run the mixed synchronization for the correct
operation of the CT Mobile app. ====
. Install the new version of the CT Mobile app.
. Run first full synchronization.

CT Mobile is ready to use.

[[h2_2143775923]]
==== How to know that the synchronization is successful?

If the synchronization was successful, the notification appears. Also,
the status indicator in the lower left corner shows the date of the last
successful synchronization.



Go back to xref:synchronization-f-a-q#F.A.Q.list[the F.A.Q. list].

[[h3_577265032]]
==== How to reduce the synchronization time?

If you have a lot of objects with attached files, you can adjust
downloading these files:

* Enable the xref:ios/mobile-application/application-settings/index.adoc#h3_1768799377[Background
content loading] option. The files in *Libraries* will be downloaded in
the background mode after the full synchronization is complete.
* Disable the xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ctm-settings/ctm-settings-offline-objects.adoc[Files Download
Enabled] option for offline objects. The files attached to offline
objects will be downloaded as previews.
* Set up the xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ctm-settings/ctm-settings-offline-objects.adoc[Files Filter] option
to set up the last date of files to download.

==== In what order are records synchronized?

During any synchronization mode, the parent records are synchronized
first, and then their child records are synchronized. To learn more
about the steps for each synchronization mode, refer to
xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/synchronization-launch/index.adoc[Synchronization Launch].

[[h2_2110567442]]
==== Does the application lock during the sync process?

The mobile application is available to work during any synchronization
mode. Also, you can collapse Mobile, and a system notification will pop
up when the synchronization is complete.

[[h3_1530730493]]
==== Where are the synchronization statistics stored?

Enable logs on the
xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-general.adoc#h3_272409891[CT Mobile
Control Panel:
General] / xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-general-new.adoc#h2_1687169837[CT
Mobile Control Panel 2.0: General] tab to collect statistics in the
[.object]#Sync Log# object. The xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/synchronization-launch/sync-log.adoc[Sync Log]
record for the selected synchronization type keeps:

* Operation. Currently, there are two available types:
** *Sync Log History* is used to store statistics for any
synchronization
** *Export Data* is used to send changes made in the CT Mobile app but
is not yet synchronized.
* Status
* Date
* Description
* Duration
* The number of transmitted records
* The number of errors occurred.
* Failed Messages

=== Metadata Archive and Related Errors Handling

[[h3_831436350]]
==== What components are included in the metadata archive?

The list of components is available
xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/metadata-archive/index.adoc#h2_1854953360[here]. Also, the metadata
archive includes all offline objects that were specified on the
xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-offline-objects.adoc[CT Mobile Control
Panel: Offline
Objects] / xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-offline-objects-new.adoc[CT Mobile
Control Panel 2.0: Offline Objects].

[[h3_317222557]]
==== How often to rebuild the metadata archive?

The frequency depends on the frequency of updating settings on the *CT
Mobile Control Panel*/*CT Mobile Control Panel 2.0* tabs, changing
lookup filters, creating custom labels, managing validation rules, etc.

[[h3_335611687]]
==== Why were not the up-to-date metadata components downloaded?

The metadata archive has not been updated. Go to the

=== Synchronization Error Handling

[[h3_1178930529]]
==== How to send the application data dump?

Go to the *Settings* screen and tap the *Send database* button to create
a ZIP archive with the app database and send it via the standard *Share*
menu on Android devices.

[[h3_1087243679]]
==== What to do if the sync process is interrupted due to a lack of an Internet connection?

If the Internet is interrupted during the sync process, you will see a
_«Network unavailable»_ notification. In that case:

. Connect your device to the Internet and wait for a while for the
device to start all the necessary services.
. Tap the
image:Start-Fast-Sync.png[]
icon in the lower-left corner to start the sync process.
. In the pop-up, tap *Start full sync* to run the mixed synchronization
or tap *Start fast sync anyway* to launch the fast synchronization.

When the sync process is complete, CT Mobile is ready to work.

[[h3_1928606629]]
==== What to do if the INSUFFICIENT ACCESS error occurs?

The error occurs when access to the records has been revoked. For
example, a mobile user created an _Activity_ record for an *Account*
record, and the manager in Salesforce revoked the user's access to that
*Account*. When the mobile user runs a fast synchronization to submit
the created _Activity_ record, they will receive an *Insufficient
Access* error.



To solve this problem, contact your administrator, request to restore
access to the parent record, and run a fast synchronization afterward.

[[h3_730956645]]
==== What to do if the mobile user is not allowed to edit the field?

The error occurs when access to a field has been revoked. For example,
while creating a record, a mobile user filled out the field, and the
manager in Salesforce revoked the user's permission to edit that field.
When the mobile user runs a fast synchronization to submit the created
record, they will receive an *Unable to create/update fields* error.



To solve this problem, contact your administrator, request to restore
access to the field, and run a fast synchronization afterward.

[[h3_996655423]]
==== What to do if the validation error occurs?

The error occurs when the validation rules are violated. For example,
while creating a record, a mobile user filled out a field with a value
that violates the validation rule created in Salesforce after the last
successful synchronization. When the mobile user runs a fast
synchronization to submit the created record, they will receive the
validation error with the error description.



To solve this problem, go to the *Validation Errors* screen, tap the
record to open it, fix the error, and run a fast synchronization
afterward.
