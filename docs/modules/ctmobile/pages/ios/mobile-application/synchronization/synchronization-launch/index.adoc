:toc:

Synchronization involves several stages of aligning CT Mobile with Salesforce, during which updated records are sent from CT Mobile to Salesforce and vice versa.

== Synchronization Modes

For information about settings for tracking and gathering the synchronization statistics, refer to xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/synchronization-launch/sync-logs.adoc[Sync Logs].

[[h3_21591833]]
=== First Full Synchronization

The entire database of the CT Mobile app, xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/metadata-archive/index.adoc[metadata components], and app settings will
be downloaded from Salesforce to the mobile device.

* This synchronization should be used after xref:ios/getting-started/logging-in/index.adoc[the authorization] of the current user.
* The first full synchronization may take a lot of time according to the database size.

For more information, go to xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/full-synchronization.adoc[First Full and Full Synchronization].

[[h3_1369866827]]
=== Full Synchronization

The entire database of the CT Mobile app, metadata components, and app settings will be replaced on the mobile device based on changes in Salesforce.

Full synchronization may take a lot of time according to the database size.

For more information, go to xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/full-synchronization.adoc[First Full and Full Synchronization].

[[h3_116633872]]
=== Fast Synchronization

Data changes, such as deletions, insertions, and updates of records, will be sent from CT Mobile to Salesforce and vice versa.

* This type is intended to align the records' main information, for example, to send new records from CT mobile app to Salesforce.
* The CT Mobile app will not be locked during the fast synchronization.
* Enable xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/ct-mobile-replication.adoc[CT Mobile Replication] if territory coordinates have been altered to download all actual data on the mobile device.
* Set up xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/sync-recovery.adoc[Sync Recovery] to have the ability to upload records with the errors to Salesforce.

For more information, go to xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/fast-synchronization.adoc[Fast and Mixed Synchronization].

[[h3_1175148825]]
=== Mixed Synchronization

This type is intended to upload the data differential since the specific date mentioned in the [.apiobject]#clm\__MetadataLastModifiedDate__c# field of
the xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/mobile-application-setup.adoc[Mobile Application Setup] custom setting and all metadata to avoid the full synchronization performing, reduce synchronization time, and use the CT Mobile app during the synchronization.

TIP: Enable xref:ios/admin-guide/metadata-checker/index.adoc[Metadata Checker] to automatically update the date in the [.apiobject]#clm\__MetadataLastModifiedDate__c# field if the metadata was changed in Salesforce.

For more information, go to xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/fast-synchronization.adoc[Fast and Mixed Synchronization].

=== Other Synchronization Modes

* xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/other-synchronization-modes.adoc#h2_1958232390[Quick Record Synchronization]
+
Used to update a single record and its child records by using the pull-to-refresh gesture on the record's layout. Requires permission (refer to xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-offline-objects.adoc#h3_202390671[CT Mobile Control Panel: Offline objects] / xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-offline-objects-new.adoc#h4_202390671[CT Mobile Control Panel 2.0: Offline Objects]).
+
You can update xref:ios/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/chatter/index.adoc[the Chatter feed] the same way, but this functionality does not depend on permission to quick record synchronization.
* xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/other-synchronization-modes.adoc#h2_740581689[Workflow Synchronization]
+
This mode of synchronization is run when xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-workflows-use-cases/ct-mobile-workflow.adoc[CT Mobile Workflow] conditions are triggered.
* xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/other-synchronization-modes.adoc#h2_233027861[CT Presenter Synchronization]
+
This mode of synchronization is triggered when the xref:ios/ct-presenter/js-bridge-api/methods-for-interaction-with-crm-data/ctm-sync.adoc[sync()] method of JS Bridge is requested.

For more information, go to xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/other-synchronization-modes.adoc[Other Synchronization Modes].

== Launch Synchronization

NOTE: Due to link:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_background[the iOS platform limitations], do not collapse the application and do not turn off the screen during the full or fast synchronization.

To launch the synchronization:

. Open the xref:ios/mobile-application/ui/home-screen/index.adoc[Home screen].
. Tap and hold the *Sync* button.
. In the pop-up, select the synchronization mode.
