= Sync Logs
:toc:

Enable sync logs and configure the appropriate reports for efficient management of synchronization statistics: average synchronization  duration, the ratio of succeeded synchronizations to failed, and many more.

== Sync Log Records

The _Sync Log_ record is created for each synchronization and each operation, such as login, create, etc., after the synchronization completion or interruption due to sync errors.

TIP: For more information, refer to xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/synchronization-launch/sync-log.adoc[Sync Log].

For example, if you performed the successful fast synchronization with the insert operation of _Account_ and _Contact_ records and the update operation of the _User_ record, the following _Sync Log_ records per each operation will be created:

* The summary _Sync Log_ record for the selected synchronization type:
** Operation: *Fast Sync*
** Status: *Success*
** Date
** Duration
** Description: *Part 1 from 1*
** The number of transmitted records
** The number of errors occurred.

* The summary _Sync Log_ record has the attachment which stores the text file with the sync logs:
** Name: *syncSingle.log*
** ParentId which stores the ID of the summary _Sync Log_ record
** Description: *Part 1 from 1*.
* The _Sync Log_ record with the insert operation of _Account_ record:
** Operation: *Insert*
** Status
** Object Name: *Account*
** Date
** Duration
** The number of transmitted records for the object
** The number of errors that occurred
** Failed messages
** Failed IDs.
* The _Sync Log_ record with the insert operation of the _Contact_ record.
* The _Sync Log_ record with the update operation of the _User_ record.
