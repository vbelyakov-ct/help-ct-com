= App Push Notification of Interrupting Synchronization

Due to
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_background[the
iOS platform limitations], we strongly recommend not collapsing the CT
Mobile app, not switching to another app, and not turning off the screen
during any synchronization.

If you perform one of these actions, after approximately 20 seconds, CT
Mobile notifies you about interrupting synchronization. In this case:

. Return to the CT Mobile app to continue synchronization. Otherwise,
when you open the CT Mobile, the alert of interrupted synchronization
will be shown.
. Tap *Sync â†’ Continue Synchronization* to complete the sync process.

When the sync process is complete, the CT Mobile app is ready to work.
