= Errors Screen

Errors occur due to violation of xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/validation.adoc[the validation
rules] and
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=security_about_sharing_rules.htm&language=en&r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&type=5[sharing
rules] or due to insufficient profile access. The *Errors* menu item is
intended to manage errors in one place and will be displayed:

* If the user postponed fixing errors on the record screen.
** The validation rule is violated on a record, and the user leaves the
record screen.
** The start date of an activity record is later than the end date, and
the user leaves the record screen.
** The required field is blank on a record or within the custom related
list, and the user leaves the record screen.
** If, for any other reason, a record cannot be successfully
synchronized with Salesforce (e.g., a required lookup filter rule has
been violated), that record will also appear on the error screen.
* If you launched the sync process and sending changes to some records
fails due to:
** Revoked access to some records.
** Insufficient access to a record or a field of the record, the
required field is empty, etc.

The list of error records is grouped by the object type. Each error
record displays the text of the error.
