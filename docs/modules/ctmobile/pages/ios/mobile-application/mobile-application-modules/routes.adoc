=== Left Menu

Sections are sorted in ascending or descending order according to the day.

NOTE: The mobile user should have access to the *Start Date field* (refer to xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-calendar.adoc#h3_1674628596[CT Mobile Control Panel: Calendar] or xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-activities-new.adoc#h4_1766544266[CT Mobile Control Panel 2.0: Activities]). Otherwise, if this field is blank, records will be randomly grouped in the section without a title.

. Records in the sections are sorted in ascending or descending order according to the start dateâ€”the records with the start date of the *Date* type are displayed first.
. Records will be grouped by day according to the [.object]#Activity# object with a title that contains the day, month, and year:
.. Records are displayed by the start date of the *Date* type.
.. Records are displayed by the start date of the *Date/Time* type.

The available list views:

* All activities (default list view);
* List views of each object grouped by the object;
* All {plus} name of the [.object]#Activity# object for objects without custom list views, e.g., _All Events_.

The last selected list view will be displayed in the Routes module.
