[[h3_908267922]]
=== Left Menu

The left menu consists of tabs with a list of accounts, contacts or references, or activity records with the specified geolocation.

* Records will be randomly grouped in the section without a title if the current user profile has no access to the start date field (refer to xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-calendar.adoc#h3_1674628596[CT Mobile Control Panel: Calendar] or xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-activities-new.adoc#h4_1766544266[CT Mobile Control Panel 2.0: Activities]) or this field is blank.
* Records will be grouped by day according to the [.object]#Activity# object with a title that contains the day, month, and year:
** Records are displayed by the start date of the *Date* type.
** Records are displayed by the start date of the *Date/Time* type.

The unsynchronized records are randomly displayed within sections according to the start date value. Sections are sorted in ascending or descending order according to the day. Records in the sections are sorted in ascending or descending order according to the start date (first displayed records with the start date of the *Date* type).

To view related contacts or references, specify the API name of the required object on the *CT Mobile Control Panel: General* tab and add this object to offline objects (refer to xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-offline-objects.adoc[CT Mobile Control Panel: Offline objects] or xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-offline-objects-new.adoc[CT Mobile Control Panel 2.0: Offline Objects]). There should be a field with the *Lookup* type on the [.object]#Contact# or [.object]#Reference# object to link them with the [.object]#Account# object.
