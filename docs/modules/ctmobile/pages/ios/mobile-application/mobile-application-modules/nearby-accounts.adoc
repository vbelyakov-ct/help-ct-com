=== Working with Nearby Accounts

//tag::ios[] //tag::win[]

==== Offline Maps

If a mobile user has no access to the Internet, she still can continue
to track the location of nearby accounts. For this purpose, download
offline maps of the desired region using Wi-Fi in advance. Follow the
instructions
in https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/find-your-way-with-maps-51ece9fb-a0f2-9853-4164-6940865085c8[Microsoft
Support].

[[h3_908267922]]
==== Left Menu

//tag::ios[]

The left menu consists of tabs with a list of accounts, contacts or
references, or activity records with the specified geolocation.

* Records will be randomly grouped in the section without a title if the
current user profile has no access to the start date field (refer to
xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-calendar.adoc#h3_1674628596[CT Mobile
Control Panel: Calendar] or

* Records will be grouped by day according to the
[.object]#Activity# object with a title that contains the day,
month, and year:
** Records are displayed by the start date of the *Date* type.
** Records are displayed by the start date of the *Date/Time* type.

The unsynchronized records are randomly displayed within sections
according to the start date value. Sections are sorted in ascending or
descending order according to the day. Records in the sections are
sorted in ascending or descending order according to the start date
(first displayed records with the start date of the *Date* type).



To view related contacts or references, specify the API name of the
required object on the *CT Mobile Control Panel: General* tab and add
this object to offline objects (refer to

the [.object]#Contact# or [.object]#Reference# object to
link them with the [.object]#Account# object.
