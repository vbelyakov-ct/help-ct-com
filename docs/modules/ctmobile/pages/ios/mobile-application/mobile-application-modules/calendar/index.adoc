= Calendar

The *Calendar* module allows you to create and manage multiple activity
objects, viz.[.object]#Activity#,[.object]#Task#, and
[.object]#Event#. Configure the *Calendar* view and apply
xref:ios/admin-guide/custom-color-settings.adoc[custom color settings] to different
activity types.

=== Calendar Interface

To learn how to work with the Calendar module, go to the
xref:ios/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/calendar/using-calendar.adoc[Using Calendar] article.

The calendar includes two main sections.

[[h3_645629234]]
==== Left menu

//tag::ios,andr,win[] Select the appropriate list view with
accounts, contacts/references, or the hierarchical view.
//tag::kotlin[] Select the appropriate list view with accounts or
contacts/references.

* If the[.object]#Reference# object is not selected in the
xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-general.adoc#h3_494016929[Reference Object
API Name] field, records of the [.object]#Contact# object will
be displayed in the *Calendar* left menu. Otherwise, records of the
[.object]#Reference# object are displayed.

//tag::ios[]

* Tap *Calendar* in the menu to quickly return to the starting
*Calendar* screen if you moved to the record details screen of the
activity and further by lookup fields or related lists.

[[h3_194347409]]
==== Main screen

//tag::ios,andr,win[] Drag-and-drop one or several records
simultaneously from the left menu to plan new activities.

//tag::kotlin[] Drag-and-drop a record from the left menu to plan
new activities, or tap the Plus button.

If configured (in xref:ct-mobile-control-panel-mini-layouts[CT
Mobile Control Panel: Mini
Layouts]/xref:ct-mobile-control-panel-mini-layouts-new[CT Mobile
Control Panel 2.0: Mini Layouts]), fill in the required fields in the
mini layout.

The title of the activity in the calendar grid is the value of the first
field in xref:ios/mobile-application/ui/compact-layout.adoc[the compact layout], and the subtitle
is the value of the second field in the compact layout.

//tag::ios[]

If necessary, xref:ios/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/calendar/set-up-holidays.adoc[set up Salesforce Holidays] to
see them on the calendar grid.

==== Algorithm for Filling Out the Lookup Field on Activity

During the *Activity* record creation by drag-and-drop an *Activity*
record to the calendar grid, the CT Mobile app fills out the
corresponding lookup field to the related object according to the
algorithm:

. If there is only one lookup field on the[.object]#Activity#
object to the related object, the lookup field will be filled out with
the record of the related object.
. If there are two and more lookup fields on the
[.object]#Activity# object to the related object, and the lookup
field has the[.apiobject]#Account#,
[.apiobject]#Contact#, or[.apiobject]#Reference#
keyword in the API name, for example,
[.apiobject]#AccountId__c#, the lookup field will be filled
out with the record of the specified object. If several lookup fields
have one of the keywords in the API name, any of them will be filled
out.
. If there are two and more lookup fields on the
[.object]#Activity# object to the related object, and none of
them has the lookup field with
the [.apiobject]#Account#, [.apiobject]#Contact#,
or [.apiobject]#Reference# keyword in the API name, any of them
will be filled out.



For the[.object]#Event# and[.object]#Task# objects,
the filling of the *Name* ([.apiobject]#WhoId#) and *Related To*
([.apiobject]#WhatId#) fields is applied.



Additional logic to fill out lookup fields:

* when a user drag-and-drops a *Contact* record to the calendar grid, CT
Mobile will also fill out the lookup field to the
[.object]#Account# object (if the field exists) during the
*Activity* record creation.
* when a user drag-and-drops a *Reference* record to the calendar grid,
CT Mobile will also fill out the lookup field to the
[.object]#Account# and *Contact* objects (if the field exists)
during the *Activity* record creation.

[[h3_1748247974]]
==== Conditions to Show Activity on the Calendar Grid

The *Activity* record is displayed in the calendar grid according to the
presence of the *Start Date* and *End Date* fields on the *Activity*
object and the values in these fields:

. If both fields are present on the _Activity_ object:â€‹
.. When both fields are filled out, the *Activity* record is displayed
in the *Day* and *Week* views.
.. When the value in one or both fields exceeds the specified visible
hour range (refer to
xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-calendar.adoc#h3_256846269[CT Mobile
Control Panel:
Calendar]/xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-app-menu-new.adoc#h2_1511584348[CT
Mobile Control Panel 2.0: App Menu]), the *Activity* record is displayed
in the *All-Day* slot in the *Day* and *Week* views.
.. When only one of the fields is filled out, the *Activity* record is
only displayed in the *Month* view.
. If there is only the *Start Date* field is present on the _Activity_
object and when this field is filled out, the Activity record is
displayed in the *All-Day* slot in the *Day* and *Week* views.
