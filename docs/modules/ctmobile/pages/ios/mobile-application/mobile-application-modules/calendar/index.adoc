=== Algorithm for Filling Out the Lookup Field on Activity

During the _Activity_ record creation by drag-and-drop an _Activity_ record to the calendar grid, the CT Mobile app fills out the corresponding lookup field to the related object according to the algorithm:

. If there is only one lookup field on the [.object]#Activity# object to the related object, the lookup field will be filled out with the record of the related object.
. If there are two and more lookup fields on the [.object]#Activity# object to the related object, and the lookup field has the [.apiobject]#Account#,
[.apiobject]#Contact#, or [.apiobject]#Reference# keyword in the API name, for example, [.apiobject]#AccountId__c#, the lookup field will be filled out with the record of the specified object. If several lookup fields have one of the keywords in the API name, any of them will be filled out.
. If there are two and more lookup fields on the [.object]#Activity# object to the related object, and none of them has the lookup field with the [.apiobject]#Account#, [.apiobject]#Contact#, or [.apiobject]#Reference# keyword in the API name, any of them will be filled out.

For the [.object]#Event# and [.object]#Task# objects, the filling of the *Name* ([.apiobject]#WhoId#) and *Related To* ([.apiobject]#WhatId#) fields is applied.

Additional logic to fill out lookup fields:

* when a user drag-and-drops a _Contact_ record to the calendar grid, CT Mobile will also fill out the lookup field to the [.object]#Account# object (if the field exists) during the _Activity_ record creation.
* when a user drag-and-drops a _Reference_ record to the calendar grid, CT Mobile will also fill out the lookup field to the [.object]#Account# and [.object]#Contact# objects (if the field exists) during the _Activity_ record creation.

[[h3_1748247974]]
=== Conditions to Show Activity on the Calendar Grid

The _Activity_ record is displayed in the calendar grid according to the presence of the *Start Date* and *End Date* fields on the [.object]#Activity# object and the values in these fields:

. If both fields are present on the [.object]#Activity# object:
.. When both fields are filled out, the _Activity_ record is displayed in the *Day* and *Week* views.
.. When the value in one or both fields exceeds the specified visible hour range (refer to xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-calendar.adoc#h3_256846269[CT Mobile Control Panel:
Calendar] / xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-app-menu-new.adoc#h3_1292798904[CT Mobile Control Panel 2.0: App Menu]), the _Activity_ record is displayed
in the *All-Day* slot in the *Day* and *Week* views.
.. When only one of the fields is filled out, the _Activity_ record is only displayed in the *Month* view.
. If there is only the *Start Date* field is present on the _Activity_ object and when this field is filled out, the Activity record is displayed in the *All-Day* slot in the *Day* and *Week* views.
