=== State and Country / Territory Picklists

By default, the following steps are required to set a country for a
user:

. Go to *Setup → Users → Users →* click *Edit* next to the required one.
. In the *Mailing Address* section, enter the country name or code in
the *Country* field.
. Click *Save*.

Use this country code while creating a *Holiday* record.



The administrator can let users add the country code from the picklist
with
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=admin_state_country_picklists_standard_countries.htm&type=5[values
of predefined&#44; standardized lists], instead of entering country data
into text fields. The country picklist offers faster and easier data
entry. It helps to ensure cleaner data that can be harnessed for other
uses, for example, in reports and dashboards.


To implement the country picklist:

. Go to *Setup → Data →* click *State and Country / Territory
Picklists*.
. Follow a step-by-step guide—refer to
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=admin_state_country_picklists_overview.htm&type=5[Let
Users Select State and Country from Picklists].

[TIP] ==== Use the predefined, standardized code for a user of a
specific country. ====
