setting will be reset during the next
xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/full-synchronization.adoc[full synchronization], as it is stored
locally in the mobile app. For xref:ios/ct-presenter/about-ct-presenter/clm-scheme/clm-customscenario.adoc[custom
scenarios], which can include all or only selected slides of the
presentation, the _favorite_ setting is stored in Salesforce, so it is
kept even after full synchronization. ====
