=== Using Email Templates

To use email templates in the CT Mobile app, they should be active, and
the mobile user should have access to appropriate email templates.

Specify markers in the [.apiobject]#{!Object.Field}# format
xref:ios/ct-presenter/js-bridge-api/methods-for-interaction-with-crm-data/crm-data-display.adoc[to display CRM data], for example,
[.apiobject]#{!User.Name}#,
[.apiobject]#{!User.LastName}#,
[.apiobject]#{!User.MobilePhone}#.

//tag::ios[]

Add
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=email_images.htm&type=5[images
in templates]:

* In Salesforce Classic, load images in
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=docs_def.htm&type=5[Documents]
and select the *Externally Available Image* option;
* In Lightning Experience, load images to
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=collab_files_overview.htm&type=5[Files].



A mobile user can send an email only to contacts who have a specified
email address in Salesforce:

* fill out the standard *Email* field for the desired _Contact_ record;
* if you use xref:ios/admin-guide/person-accounts.adoc[Person Accounts], fill out the
standard *Email* field for the desired *Person Account* record.

//tag::kotlin[]



To send a letter with an attachment:

. Open the *Notes & Attachments* tab of the desired record.
. Long tap an attachment.
. Tap the *Send* button in the upper-right corner.
. Select an email template if needed.
. Select a recipient.
. Select an app, for example, Gmail, to send a letter.
. Edit the letter if needed.
. Tap to send the letter.

The letter is sent.
