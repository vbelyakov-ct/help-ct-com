= Salesforce Winter &#39;22 Release

https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_lc_oauth_ru.htm&type=5&release=232[In
this release], Salesforce enforces the scope of an OAuth token used to
authenticate a Lightning app.

* The scope of an OAuth token is defined in a connected app.
* This change prevents a Lightning app from using OAuth tokens with
unintended permissions.



The OAuth scope should be set to one of the following values, depending
on your appâ€™s requirements.

* Allow access to Lightning applications (lightning)
* Provide access to custom applications (visualforce)
* Provide access to your data via the Web (web)
* Full access (full). Use this option only if none of the other options
are sufficient.



The *CT Mobile* and *CT Presenter* connected apps have full access,
which means no actions are required to prepare for this update.
