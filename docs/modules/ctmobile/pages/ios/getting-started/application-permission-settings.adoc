CT Mobile users should be divided by their roles, for example, admins, supervisors, and field forces. For this purpose, define profiles for various user types and assign permission sets or use permission set groups to extend user access. Also, manage sharing rules to define access exceptions.

== Profiles

WARNING: We kindly ask you to set up a separate profile for a user who configures the system. The user should have the _Modify All Data_ and _Modify Metadata Through Metadata API Functions_ permissions and access to all fields and objects.

To use xref:ios/mobile-application/ui/home-screen/index.adoc#h3_1361691321[the mobile logo], a mobile user should have access to the *Documents* folder. Please check the following:

* At least permission to read the *Documents* object is assigned to the mobile user.
* At least permission to read and edit the *Documents* object is assigned to the administrator.
* The _CT CLM_ folder is link:https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.creating_and_editing_folders.htm&type=5[accessible by all users].

link:https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.admin_userprofiles.htm&type=5[A profile] is an array of settings and permissions that define what a user can do in the CT Mobile app.

* A profile controls object permissions, field permissions, user permissions, tab settings, app settings, Apex class access, Visualforce page access, page layouts, record types, login hours, and login IP ranges.
* A profile can be assigned to many users, but a user can be assigned to a single profile at a time.
* A user's profile should be specified on some xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/index.adoc[CT Mobile Control Panel] tabs to define the required user's permissions.

There are two types of profiles:

* *Standard profiles* are provided by default. These profiles cannot be deleted.
* *Custom profiles* are user-defined profiles. These profiles can be deleted if no users are assigned to them.

=== Set Up a New Profile

Define profiles by the user’s function. You can create and assign a new profile to a user or change the profile for another one. Changing the user's profile may cause access issues to records in the CT Mobile app and errors during the synchronization.

For example, access to an object has been withdrawn from the mobile user's profile after the last full synchronization. During the next fast synchronization, the [.apiobject]#INVALID_TYPE# error may occur because some records are no more available. We recommend enabling xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/sync-recovery.adoc[Sync Recovery] to process errors or xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/ct-mobile-replication.adoc[CT Mobile Replication] to hide these unavailable records and download the correct ones.

To create and set up a new profile:

. Go to *Setup → Users → Profiles*.

. Click *New Profile*.
+
Also, you can click *Clone* next to the desired profile to copy all its settings to a new one.
. Select the *Existing Profile* from the drop-down list.
. Enter the new profile name and click *Save*.
. Click *Edit* and set up permissions.
. Click *Save*.

The profile is ready to use. link:https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.users_profiles_assigned_users.htm&type=5[Assign desired users] to a profile.

== Permission Sets and Permission Set Groups

A user can be assigned to a single profile at a time, but can also have multiple permission sets. link:https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=perm_sets_overview.htm&type=5[A permission set] is a collection of settings and permissions that give users access to various tools and functions.

* A profile gives minimum permissions and settings access for a user or specific user groups.
* A permission set extends a user's permissions and grants more access without changing a user's profile.
* link:https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.perm_set_groups.htm&type=5[A permission set group] helps to assign several permission sets together based on user job functions. Users with assigned the permission set group receive the combined permissions of all the permission sets in the
group.

[[h3_2115044027]]
=== Required Permission Sets

WARNING: We kindly ask you to assign the preconfigured permission sets to all users in your system according to their roles.

For your convenience, we create two permission sets that include configured access to all required objects and fields depending on the user type.

* _CT Mobile Administrator_ should be assigned to admins. It contains all required permissions and access to all required Apex classes for the correct operation of the CT Mobile package and CT Mobile app.
* _CT Mobile User_ should be assigned to users who will work with the CT Mobile app as field forces, supervisors, etc. according to your business purposes. If a user needs to work with presentations, _CT Mobile Presenter_ permission set also should be assigned.
* _CT Mobile List View_ should be assigned to those who need to view and edit offline list views (access to [.object]#CTM User Settings# object).
* _CT Mobile Presenter_ should be assigned to those who need to work with CLM presentations.

[[h2_1133416231]]
== Sharing Rules

link:https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.managing_the_sharing_model.htm&type=5[Sharing rules] are used to control user access at the record level. Currently, the CT Mobile app cannot correctly handle records with the *Public Read-Only* access.

For example, the *Public Read-Only* access is specified for the [.object]#Account# object, and the mobile user's profile has permission to edit and delete records of the [.object]#Account# object. In the CT Mobile app, the mobile user can edit and delete all downloaded _Account_ records, but errors will occur during the synchronization if the mobile user has deleted or edited records that they do not own.

[[h2_631577805]]
== Restriction Rules

link:https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.security_restriction_rule.htm&type=5[Restriction rules] are used to allow certain users to access only specified records. They prevent users from accessing records that contain sensitive data or information that isn’t essential to their work.

After setting restriction rules, the user does not see certain records in Salesforce, and the same records will not be able to the user in the CT Mobile after synchronization.
