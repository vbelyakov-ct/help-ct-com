=== Session Expiration

After link:ios/logging-in[logging in], a user establishes a session
with the CT Mobile app.

A user can log in to Salesforce
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000340179&type=1&mode=1[using
up to 5 mobile devices] concurrently. If a user logs in to Salesforce
using a 6th mobile device, they will receive a message indicating that
'already 5 login sessions exist' and the oldest app session will be
logged out.

By default, the session timeout value is set to 2 hours. The following
actions within the application may trigger the session expiration
effect:

* Initializing any synchronization process.
* Accessing dashboards.
* Downloading files.
* Chatter activities (likes and new posts).



When a mobile user performs one of the actions above:

* If there is an internet connection and the access token is valid, all
offline and online features of the mobile application are available to
the mobile user.
* If there is no internet connection, the info message reports that the
internet connection failed. The action cannot be done, but the mobile
user can still work in the CT Mobile app in offline mode.

* If the Salesforce password was changed, the mobile user continues to
work with the CT Mobile app and also can perform
link:ios/synchronization[synchronization]. A new password is not
required.

* If there is an internet connection and the access token is not valid,
the mobile user will be forced out from the CT Mobile app to the login
screen. The database will be intact. To continue working with the mobile
application, the mobile user should log in again.
* If another user logs in on the same device, the CT Mobile app warns
that the previous user's database will be reset.
