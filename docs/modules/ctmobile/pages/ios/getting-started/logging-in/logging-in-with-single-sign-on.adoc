= Logging In with Single Sign-On

Single sign-on (SSO) lets users access authorized network resources with
one login.



Salesforce uses the SAML protocol for single sign-on into Salesforce
from a corporate portal or identity provider.

* Your identity provider sends SAML assertions to Salesforce using the
SAML web Single Sign-on Browser POST profile. Salesforce sends SAML
responses to the identity provider login URL specified under Setup by
entering _Single Sign-On_ in the Quick Find box, then selecting Single
Sign-On Settings. Salesforce receives the assertion, verifies it against
your Salesforce configuration, and, if the assertion is true, allows
SSO.

SAML Settings for Single Sign-On].
* As an identity provider, you can use
