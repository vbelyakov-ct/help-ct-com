= CT Mobile Managed Package Update to v. 3.54

In compliance with Salesforce security policy and since the CT Mobile
package v. 3.54:

* The administrator credentials are no more in use to retrieve metadata
during the synchronization.
* User access to the cloud token is restricted.
** Now, the cloud token is written to the protected
link:api-key[API Key] custom setting and retrieved by the web
service.
** As before, link:application-permission-settings[administrators]
could view and refresh the cloud token value on the
link:ct-mobile-control-panel-tools[CT Mobile Control Panel: Tools].



Consider the following while working with the CT Mobile package v. 3.54
and higher:

* link:ct-mobile-control-panel-tools#h2__203730205[The
administrator credentials] are no more available on the CT Mobile
Control Panel: Tools tab and are no more in use to download metadata on
the user's device.
* link:metadata-archive[The metadata archive] should be built. This
allows all the necessary metadata to be downloaded to the user's device
for the CT Mobile app to work properly offline.

[TIP] ==== Enable link:metadata-checker[Metadata Checker]
or click the
link:ct-mobile-control-panel-tools#h3_1003786176[Refresh metadata
archive] button to build the metadata archive. Please note that the
process will take some time.  ====

* link:ct-mobile-control-panel-tools#h3_2011978[The cloud token] is
required to download the metadata archive during the synchronization on
the user's device.
* If the cloud token is invalid or there is no metadata archive, the CT
Mobile app downloads metadata using the user's credentials. Validation
rules, dashboards, and some operations in formulas will not be available
offline.



Please get familiar with the comparison table of functionalities
available for users according to their devices platforms and versions of
the CT Mobile package and app.
