= Fields with the Double Type

Consider the following notes that can affect formula calculation when filling fields with the *Double* type with numbers longer than 16 characters:

* Salesforce automatically rounds a number longer than 16 digits: an 18-digit number will be rounded by two digits, and a 17-digit number will be rounded by one digit. After synchronization, CT Mobile gets a number that is already rounded. For example:
** 222 222 222 222 222 222 → 222 222 222 222 222 200
** 222 222 222 222 222 22 → 222 222 222 222 222 24
* When working with the CT Mobile app:
** A 15-digit number is stored in exponential form.
** A 16-digit number is stored in numeric form.
** A 17 or 18-digit number is automatically converted to exponential. After synchronization, the number will be rounded on the Salesforce side. For example:
+
222 222 222 222 222 222 → 222 222 222 222 222 000 = 2,22222222222222e17
