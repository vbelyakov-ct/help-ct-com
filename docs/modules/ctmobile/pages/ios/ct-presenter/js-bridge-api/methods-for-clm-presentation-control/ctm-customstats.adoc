=== Query Format



The[.apiobject]#slideName# line should be Latin, 40 characters
max, and without blank spaces.

* Requesting this method, CT Mobile creates an *Application Stats*
record with the *Slide Stats* record type where it keeps records of view
time, likes, displays, etc. until[.apiobject]#ctm.customStats#
with a different[.apiobject]#slideName# is requested or the CLM
presentation display mode is closed.
* The[.apiobject]#slideName# value will be stored
link:clm-applicationstats[in the File Name field].
* If the method with the same[.apiobject]#slideName# is called
again, CT Mobile must append the previously created *Application Stats*
record.
