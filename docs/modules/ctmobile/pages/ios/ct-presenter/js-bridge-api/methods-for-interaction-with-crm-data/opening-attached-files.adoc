= Opening Attached Files

The CT Mobile app allows opening the attached files in a native window. The opened files may be sent to an email address.

To open the PDF file, for example,[.apiobject]#filename.pdf# from attachments of the CLM presentation:

[source,html]
----
<a href="filename.pdf">Link to file</a>
----

To open a file from the [.apiobject]#sources.zip# with the *filename* name:

[source,html]
----
window.open(filename)
----

This method also works via the xref:ios/ct-presenter/the-remote-detailing-functionality/index.adoc[Remote Detailing] session.

To open any file from the [.apiobject]#sources.zip#, use the following according to the path:

[source,html]
----
src="file.pdf"

src="folder/image.png"
----

Also, it is possible to launch the script from the [.apiobject]#sources.zip# using the path to it:

[source,html]
----
<script src="js/hammer.js"></script>
----

It is possible to open files that are locally stored in xref:ios/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/libraries.adoc[the Libraries module]. The file name should be written without spaces.

Opens the file from the Libraries module with the [.apiobject]#15Mb.mp4# file name:

[source,html]
----
<a href="15Mb.mp4">Open file from Libraries</a>
----
