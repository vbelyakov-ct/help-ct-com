= JS Bridge API

JS Bridge is the interface of the interaction of CLM-presentation with
Salesforce data. To start using it,
link:activating-js-bridge[activate the JS Bridge library].

It is used for capturing and displaying data from the Salesforce system
objects ([.object]#Accounts#,[.object]#Contacts#,
[.object]#Calls#, etc.), for launching the CT Mobile features,
e.g., the synchronization process, and for slide navigation during the
CLM presentation.



It can be used for capturing data during the CLM-presentation for
further storage in CT Mobile and then synchronize with Salesforce. For
example, if a user starts a CLM presentation from the *Activity* mobile
layout and this *Activity* record is related to an *Account* and a
*Contact* records, the platform allows
link:crm-data-display[displaying data from the following objects]:

*[.object]#Account# (in case if relationship from visit
exists).
*[.object]#Contact# (in case if relationship from visit
exists).
*[.object]#Reference# (in case if relationship from visit
exists).
*[.object]#Activity#.
*[.object]#Activity Data#.



Data, registered in one slide, can be stored only on a single object
without exceeding the field number limitations. Saving field values is
performed after changing a slide or closing the slideshow.

Example of JS Bridge API that fetches data from the system (Account
name, Contact name of this account) and displays in a presentation:
