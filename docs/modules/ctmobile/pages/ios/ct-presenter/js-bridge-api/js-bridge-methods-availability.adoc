[[h2_868831931]]
== Important Notes

When you launch the *Remote Detailing* meeting in the CT Mobile app, CRM  data captured by JS Bridge will be uploaded to Salesforce and not stored on the mobile device. A user should have permission to edit records of the corresponding object. For example, if you create a new record using [.apiobject]#ctm.create#, it will be uploaded to Salesforce, and
you should launch xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/fast-synchronization.adoc[fast synchronization] to download it to a mobile device.

When you open a CLM presentation in the *Application* module, from the carousel of CLM presentations on the Home screen or mobile layout in the CT Mobile app, CRM data captured by JS Bridge will be saved to the mobile device. In this case, the corresponding object should be available offline, and a user should have permission to edit its records. To upload data to Salesforce, perform the fast synchronization.
