== Integrated CLM and CRM

CT Presenter enables client-facing interactions using CLM presentations via various channels.

CLM presentations can include interactive product presentations, educative and training materials, videos, references, links to external websites, mini-applications for trade & retail audits, contract visualization, etc.

As CT Presenter is tightly integrated with CT Mobile, CLM presentations can interact with the mobile offline database of the CT Mobile app using xref:ios/ct-presenter/js-bridge-api/index.adoc[read/write access to CRM data]. In CLM presentations, images, videos, and attached PDFs can be used from the existing media libraries. For example, it is possible to develop complex CLM presentations based on HTML5 for product presentation along with
retail audit and order taking. It will be a visually and functionally advanced presentation, which can provide a full “route map” of a visit and support with interactive tools for the actions that are needed to take during the call.

CLM presentations are structured within the Salesforce data model and store HTML5 content and related resources in the Salesforce database. CT Presenter provides the data model and tools for xref:ios/ct-presenter/about-ct-presenter/clm-scheme/clm-applicationstats.adoc[CLM-presentations tracking and usage analysis for further improvement], e.g., shown slides, duration of every slide shown, clicks, etc. As all the statistics of content usage are stored in the Salesforce database, it is easy to run reports and develop integrated reports on CRM {plus} CLM performance indicators of the reps.
