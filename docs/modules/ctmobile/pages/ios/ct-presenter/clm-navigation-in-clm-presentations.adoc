=== Branches

Slides from one or several CLM presentation(s) may be organized in the
branches, and each branch will be launched depending on the choice of
the user.

[TIP] ==== Double tap at the bottom of the screen to display
slides in a branch for rapid switching between the slides. To jump to
another branch, use one of
xref:ios/ct-presenter/js-bridge-api/methods-for-clm-presentation-navigation/index.adoc[the JS Bridge methods
for navigation]. ====

For example, the presentation may include a home page that contains
buttons for navigating through the presentation. On this slide, a user
can choose what path of the presentation to take by tapping one of the
headers.

Each slide should have a unique order number.

It is recommended to number branches as 0, 1, 2, etc., and number slides
as 01, 02, â€¦, 11, 12, etc., where a first number is a branch number, and
a second is an order slide number in this branch.
