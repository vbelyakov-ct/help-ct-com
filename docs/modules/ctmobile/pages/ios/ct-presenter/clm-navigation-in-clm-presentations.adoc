=== Branches

Slides from one or several CLM presentation(s) may be organized in the
branches, and each branch will be launched depending on the choice of
the user.

[TIP] ==== Double tap at the bottom of the screen to display
slides in a branch for rapid switching between the slides. To jump to
another branch, use one of
xref:methods-for-clm-presentation-navigation[the JS Bridge methods
for navigation]. ====

For example, the presentation may include a home page that contains
buttons for navigating through the presentation. On this slide, a user
can choose what path of the presentation to take by tapping one of the
headers.

It is recommended to number branches as 0, 1, 2, etc., and number slides
as 01, 02, â€¦, 11, 12, etc., where a first number is a branch number, and
a second is an order slide number in this branch.
