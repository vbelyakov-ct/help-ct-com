= Attach Files to CLM Presentation

The xref:ios/ct-presenter/about-ct-presenter/clm-scheme/attachments-and-files.adoc[Attachment] section on the _Application_ record is used to store:

* [.apiobject]#.jpeg#,[.apiobject]#.pdf#, [.apiobject]#.html#, etc., which can be used from within CLM presentation and xref:ios/ct-presenter/js-bridge-api/methods-for-interaction-with-crm-data/opening-attached-files.adoc[should be specified] in the *Slide* markup.
* project files in the ZIP archive(s).

Attachment requirements for ZIP archives:

* The file size should be no more than 25 MB. If the attachment is larger than 25 MB, it should be split into several ZIP archives.
* The file extension for ZIP archives should be .zip with the source's name. The available formats:
** the [.apiobject]#sources[n].zip# format, where [.apiobject]#[n]# is the number of the archive part, starting from 1.
** for convenience of use, it is possible to use the 7-Zip utility program to create and automatically divide archives into parts of less than 25 MB in the [.apiobject]#sources.zip.00[n]# format, where [.apiobject]#[n]# is the number of the archive part, starting from 1.

NOTE: Even if the attachment limit is extended by Salesforce support, there is no way to overcome the file size limit of 25 MB.
