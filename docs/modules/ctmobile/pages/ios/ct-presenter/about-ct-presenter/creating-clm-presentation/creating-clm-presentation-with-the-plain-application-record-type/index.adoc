= Creating CLM Presentation with the Plain Application record type

* CLM presentations with the *Plain Application* record type can be
created without HTML programming. Import a PowerPoint file or create a
CLM presentation using templates, slides with images, texts, videos,
etc.
* Markups for all slides will be stored in the first slide record. We
recommend creating no more than 25 slides.
* Before the CLM presentation creation,
read link:ios/requirements-and-media-file-formats[Requirements and
Media File Formats] and link:ios/remote-site-settings[set up remote
sites].



To create CLM presentations with the *Plain Application* record type:

. Go to the *Application Editor* tab.
. Select the application in the picklist.
. Select the desired way to create the CLM Presentation:

* link:ios/creating-plain-clm-presentation[Create a CLM presentation by
adding slide by slide&#44; and configure template placeholders and
widgets].
* link:ios/creating-plain-clm-presentation-using-templates[Create a CLM
presentation based on the template]link:ios/creating-a-widget[].
* link:ios/creating-plain-clm-presentation-from-powerpoint[Create a CLM

[NOTE] ====

The *Application Editor* creates slides of the CLM presentations by
taking screenshots of[.apiobject]#.ppt(x) ==== slides.

If a

.ppt(x)# file contains any interactive elements, such as videos, gifs,
and links, they will not be available in the converted CLM presentation.
