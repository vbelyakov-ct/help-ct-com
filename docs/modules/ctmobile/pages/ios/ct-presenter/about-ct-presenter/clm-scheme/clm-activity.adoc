meetings.

that must be set in xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-calendar.adoc[CT Mobile

|*Field* |*API Name* |*Type* |*Description*

|Application Ids |[.apiobject]#ApplicationIds__c# a|

description] for the fields of the *Text* type. ====

For *Remote Detailing*, create a field that stores CLM presentations
IDs:

* a field with the Lookup type to put only one CLM-presentation ID in
* a field with the Text type to store a few IDs (separated by a comma,
without blank space).

The field to store [.object]#Application# IDs should have the
same API name on any [.object]#Activity# object for the Remote
Detailing session.



You can specify a process, for example, to create a trigger to
autocomplete this field with values from the pre-configured picklist.

Create a field to store xref:ios/admin-guide/system-label.adoc[the system label] in a
case where the record was created/edited in the CT Mobile app.

The use of another API name is not possible.

|RD Link |[.apiobject]#RDLink__c# |URL a|
For *Remote Detailing*, create a field to fill it out with an invitation
link.



The field to store an invitation link should have the same API name on
any [.object]#Activity# object for the Remote Detailing session.

|Email Required |[.apiobject]#IsEmailRequired__c# |Checkbox

If enabled, the user is required to provide an email on
