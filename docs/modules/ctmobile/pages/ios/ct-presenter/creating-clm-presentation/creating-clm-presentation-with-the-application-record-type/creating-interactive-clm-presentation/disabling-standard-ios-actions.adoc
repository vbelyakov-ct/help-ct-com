= Disabling Standard iOS Actions

It is possible to disable the standard iOS functionalities, such as open a popup or highlight an element, for example, when the standard action is used on a slide for other purposes.

In this case, use the following code for each element on a slide to disable the iOS action:

[source,css]
----
*{

-webkit-touch-callout: none;

-webkit-user-select: none;

-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba{0, 0, 0, 0};

}
