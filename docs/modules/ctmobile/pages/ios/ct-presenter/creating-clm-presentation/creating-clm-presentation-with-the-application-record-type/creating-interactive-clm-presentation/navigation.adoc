= Navigation

Do not use navigation frameworks to avoid overlap with CT Presenter
navigation methods.



Branches are sets of CLM presentation slides, single scenarios that run
depending on the user's choice. To navigate among scenarios, restrict
default gestures on slides:

* Activate the Fixed attribute of a Slide object to disable a default
gesture to swipe a slide to the next one. 
* Default gestures are not in use to switch the last slide in a branch.

==== Switching Slides

To switch a slide:

* Use default gestures for switching slides within a branch
* Add in a slide markup one of the following methods to start a branch
and switching among branches:
**[.apiobject]#<a
href="#slide[k]">Text</a>#, where
[.apiobject]#[k]# is a slide order.
**[.apiobject]#<a
href="[n][k]_start_slide.html">Home</a>#,
where:
***[.apiobject]#[n]# is the number of a branch
***[.apiobject]#[k]# is the number of a slide in the
appropriate branch
***[.apiobject]#start_slide# is a name of a file that
represents a slide.
[NOTE] ==== This markup works only for web browsers. ====
* Use the[.apiobject]#CTAPPgoTo…# methods or a library to
process a default gesture, for example,[.apiobject]#hammer.js#,
to switch the last or fixed slide.
