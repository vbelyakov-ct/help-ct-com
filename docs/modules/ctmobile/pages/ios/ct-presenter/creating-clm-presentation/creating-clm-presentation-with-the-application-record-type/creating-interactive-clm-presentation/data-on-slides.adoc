==== Display CRM Data

CT Presenter allows displaying CRM data from the related records of
offline objects on a slide.

Use the following format in a slide markup:
[.apiobject]#{!$ObjectName.FieldAPIName}#. In case of blank
value of the displayed field, marker is set to space.



For example:

*{!$Contact.FirstName}{!$Contact.LastName}
*{!$Account.Name}

==== Data Storage

CT Presenter allows recording and passing different information to
Salesforce during the CLM presentation demonstration.

Users can fill out a form or add some information to placeholders on a
slide. But when a user switches to other slides, data will be erased. To
avoid this, in the slide markup, specify a place to store the entered
information: 

*[.apiobject]#localStorage# for storing data locally on the
user's device
*[.apiobject]#sessionStorage# for keeping data for the current
CLM presentation demonstration
