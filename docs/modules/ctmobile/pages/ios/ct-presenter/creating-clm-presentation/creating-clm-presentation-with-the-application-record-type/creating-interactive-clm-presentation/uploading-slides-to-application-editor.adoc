= Uploading Slides to Application Editor

CLM presentation slides must be loaded to the Application Editor as the
xref:ios/ct-presenter/about-ct-presenter/clm-scheme/clm-slide.adoc[Slide] object.

To simplify work with slides, especially when there are several
scenarios within a CLM presentation, use the following format for
naming:[.apiobject]#slide-[n][k].html#, where
[.apiobject]#[n]# is the number of a branch and
[.apiobject]#[k]# is the number of a slide in the
appropriate branch.

You can count slides from either 0 or 1. Branches are always counted
from 0. For example, the first slide of a CLM presentation always has
[.apiobject]#[n] = 0# and may have
[.apiobject]#[k] = 0# or
[.apiobject]#[k] = 1: slide-00.html#,
[.apiobject]#slide-01.html#.

[NOTE] ==== When you uploaded slides in Salesforce, you should
specify the Order and Branch for a slide. Note that Salesforce
automatically[.apiobject]#hide[n] = 0 ==== in the
slide order.#

you have uploaded ZIP archive(s) to the Application Editor and you need
to change something on a slide, like adding a new image or replacing a
video:

. Download[.apiobject]#sources.zip# from the Application Editor
that contains the content you want to replace.
. Remove the sources.zip (step 1) from the Application Editor.
. Replace the content in the downloaded sources.zip.
. Upload the updated sources.zip (step 3) to the Application Editor.

[WARNING] ==== Do not modify or remove from the Application
Editor other sources.zip ==== that used in the CLM presentation.
