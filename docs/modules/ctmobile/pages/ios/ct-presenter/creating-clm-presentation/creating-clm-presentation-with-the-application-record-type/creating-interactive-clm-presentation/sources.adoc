= The sources.zip Structure

Each CLM presentation has sources—a variety of content and assets:

* media, such as images, GIFs, video, and audio
* attached files, such as .pdf, .doc(x), etc.
* styles and fonts
* JSONs and JS methods.

Content and associated CLM presentation assets must be packed in ZIP
archive(s) in order to load them to Salesforce.

* The size of a ZIP archive cannot exceed 25 MB. Otherwise, it must be
split into several ZIP archives.
* The file extension must be .zip.
* The available formats:[.apiobject]#sources[n].zip#,
where [.apiobject]#[n]# is the number of the archive
part, starting from 1.
* You can use the 7-Zip utility to create and divide ZIP archives into
parts less than 25 MB. In this case, the output format will be
[.apiobject]#sources.zip.00[n]#,
where [.apiobject]#[n]# is the number of the archive
part, starting from 1. Select the ZIP format when creating an archive.
* {blank}

The ZIP archive may contain folders and subfolders.

[WARNING] ==== Do not create a ZIP archive with the
[.apiobject]#Sources ==== folder that include folders with
images, video, etc. The [.apiobject]#sources/images/image-1.jpg# path will not be handled.#

The [.apiobject]#sources.zip# structure:
