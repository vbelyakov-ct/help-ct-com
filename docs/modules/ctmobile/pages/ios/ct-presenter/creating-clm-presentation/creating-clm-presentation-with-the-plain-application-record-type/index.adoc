= Creating CLM Presentation with the Plain Application record type

* CLM presentations with the *Plain Application* record type can be
created without HTML programming. Import a PowerPoint file or create a
CLM presentation using templates, slides with images, texts, videos,
etc.
* Markups for all slides will be stored in the first slide record. We
recommend creating no more than 25 slides.
* Before the CLM presentation creation,
read xref:requirements-and-media-file-formats[Requirements and
Media File Formats] and xref:ios/admin-guide/remote-site-settings.adoc[set up remote
sites].



To create CLM presentations with the *Plain Application* record type:

. Go to the *Application Editor* tab.

[NOTE] ====

The *Application Editor* creates slides of the CLM presentations by
taking screenshots of[.apiobject]#.ppt(x) ==== slides.

If a

.ppt(x)# file contains any interactive elements, such as videos, gifs,
and links, they will not be available in the converted CLM presentation.
