= The CT Presenter app

NOTE: CT Presenter app is deprecated and will be removed from the Apple App Store soon.

The CT Presenter app for iPad is a solution of the CT Products family that is intended to facilitate remote interactions between the sales presenter and clients (HCPs, buyers) to achieve the most engaging user experience.

With the invite link, participants of the xref:ios/ct-presenter/the-remote-detailing-functionality/index.adoc[Remote Detailing] meeting could enter the meeting via the CT Presenter app installed on their devices and, according to the permissions, perform actions, such as stream video and audio, like/dislike slides, or answer the questions on a slide.
