link to the *Activity* record created in the app.



If the invitation link appeared neither in Salesforce nor in the CT

=== What to do in case of sound and video issues during the Remote Detailing meeting?

Due to Apple's limitations, the device's microphone and camera do not
work in web view and may also not work correctly in
xref:remote-detailing-f-a-q#h3_1979411778[mobile browsers] due to
their limitations.



The sound and video issues can be related to the device's camera and
microphone settings:

The same xref:ct-presenter[CLM presentations] and custom scenarios

available during the *Remote Detailing* meeting.

* Check xref:requirements-and-media-file-formats[requirements and
media file formats] for CLM presentations.

** Add processing the tap event along with the click event into the
slide markup to display the presenter tap or click movement for
participants.

xref:ct-mobile-control-panel-presenter#h3_949497961[CRM Data
Streaming Enabled]/
xref:ct-mobile-control-panel-remote-detailing-new#h4_1433734342[CRM
Data Sharing] attribute to use the available JS Bridge methods

use the Applications button on the Activity record in Lightning
Experience].

xref:ios/ct-presenter/about-ct-presenter/clm-scheme/clm-application.adoc[Application] record to copy and insert the
code of the CLM presentation for displaying on your website.

display CLM presentations with good quality. Pinch with two fingers to
zoom in or out up to x300 on the mobile device or use the zoom slider on
the PC.
* For the *Self Detailing* meeting, it is necessary to previously
xref:publishing-clm-presentations#h3_1098755975[renew slides] for
