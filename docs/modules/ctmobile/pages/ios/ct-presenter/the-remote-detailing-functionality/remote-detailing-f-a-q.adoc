== What to do in case of sound and video issues during the Remote Detailing meeting?

Due to Apple's limitations, the device's microphone and camera do not work in web view and may also not work correctly in <<h3_1979411778,mobile browsers>> due to their limitations.

The sound and video issues can be related to the device's camera and microphone settings:

. Previously, check <<h2_1998516434,the supported browsers on devices>>.
. Check camera and microphone permissions on your device:
* *Windows 10*

== What are the requirements for the CLM presentations? What features are available?

The same xref:ios/ct-presenter/index.adoc[CLM presentations] and custom scenarios as for the *Application* module in the CT Mobile app can be used for
*Remote Detailing*.

* xref:ios/ct-presenter/about-ct-presenter/clm-scheme/clm-application.adoc[CLM presentation] should be active and available for *Remote Detailing*. For *Remote Detailing 2.0*, If CLM presentations are not set for the _Activity_ record, all active and available for *Remote Detailing* meetings CLM presentations will be available during the *Remote Detailing* meeting.

* Specify the xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-presenter.adoc#h3_949497961[CRM Data Streaming Enabled] / xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-remote-detailing-new.adoc#h4_1433734342[CRM Data Sharing] attribute to use the available JS Bridge methods implemented on the slide markup.
* Several CLM presentations and custom scenarios can be presented in one session. Specify CLM presentations manually in Salesforce Classic or xref:ios/ct-presenter/the-remote-detailing-functionality/remote-detailing-setup/remote-detailing-apex-trigger-classes-and-quick-action.adoc[add and use the Applications button on the Activity record in Lightning Experience].

[[h2_1142420759]]
== How can I manage a CLM presentation during the Remote Detailing meeting?
