Since CT Mobile 2.6, the app supports Split View and Slide Over
multitasking types. Note the following:

* We do not guarantee that screens adapted for landscape orientation
will display correctly in portrait orientation. In future releases, we
will add a warning to prevent such screens from being used in portrait
orientation.
* We cannot limit the minimum percentage of screen area in Split View
mode and recommend using at least 75% of the screen to work with CT
Mobile.
