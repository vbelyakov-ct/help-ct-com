= Geo Tracing Sync Log

When the user performed the first synchronization, the _Sync Log_ record for the *Geo Tracing* operation will be created.

According to the tracking interval (refer to xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-general.adoc#h3_1808523151[CT Mobile Control Panel: General] / xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-general-new.adoc#h3_1808523151[CT Mobile Control Panel 2.0: General]), CT Mobile monitors the user's coordinates. If the user has changed their location, the coordinates will be saved in the [.apiobject]#clm\__GeoTracing__c# field, and the time will be saved in the
[.apiobject]#clm\__GeoTiming__c# field. If the user has not changed their location, the fields will not be updated.

Once a day, the _Sync Log_ record for the *Geo Tracing* operation will be sent to Salesforce. If a _Sync Log_ record is already stored on the server, it will be downloaded from Salesforce.

* The _Sync Log_ record stores the set of the user's coordinates captured on the current user's local time according to the tracking interval.
* The received coordinates per user's local time are used to build a route on xref:./using-geolocation-center.adoc#h2_1475553155[the Activities tab] of the *Geolocation Center* tab.

there is a «_Please check field visibility settings for fields: Geo Timing (clm\__GeoTiming__c) and Geo Tracing (clm\__GeoTracing__c)_.» warning.

|Geo Timing |[.apiobject]#clm\__GeoTiming__c# |Long Text Area(131072) |The user local time when the coordinates were captured (separated by a semicolon, without blank spaces).
