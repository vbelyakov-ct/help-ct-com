= Security Token

[WARNING] ==== For users of CT Mobile package version below
3.54. ====

When you access Salesforce from an IP address that is outside your
company’s trusted IP range using a desktop client or the API, you need a
security token to log in. A security token is a case-sensitive
alphanumeric code that you append to your password or enter it in a
separate field in a client application.



In case the security token is expired, some application functionality
may be unavailable. The log will contain the following message:
_Administrator credentials are not valid. Validation rules and
dashboards may work not properly in offline mode_.
