*Related List Filters* is a setting of the list type to store data about
filters applied to the corresponding
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=customizing_related_lists.htm&type=5[related
lists] of records while displaying them in the mobile application. This
parameter is also responsible for selection criteria that are used for

[TIP] ==== For easy setup, go to
link:ios/ct-mobile-control-panel-offline-objects[CT Mobile Control
Panel: Offline
Objects]/link:ios/ct-mobile-control-panel-offline-objects-new[CT Mobile
Control Panel 2.0: Offline Objects]. ====

The following system variables can be used as criteria:

*[.apiobject]#$User#
*[.apiobject]#$UserRole#
*[.apiobject]#$Profile#

For example, the[.apiobject]#{$User.Id}# criterion
specified in parameters will automatically be set to a current user ID.
Using such system variables will dynamically query the data relevant to
the current user.
