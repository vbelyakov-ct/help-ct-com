= Reference Object

In the CT Mobile package, administrators can specify the [.object]#Reference# object according to the business goals.

To set up the [.object]#Reference# object:

[tabs]
====
In CT Mobile Control Panel::
+
--
. Go to the xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-general.adoc#h3_494016929[CT Mobile Control Panel: General] tab.
. In the *Reference Object API Name* field, select the desired object.
. Click *Save*.

In CT Mobile Control Panel 2.0::
+
--
. Go to the xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-general-new.adoc#h3_351797814[CT Mobile Control Panel 2.0: General].
. In the *Relate Contact to Multiple Accounts by Junction Object*, select the desired object.
. Click *Save*.
--
====

The setup is complete. Launch xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/full-synchronization.adoc[full synchronization] to apply the setting.

As the [.object]#Reference# object, use the junction object between the [.object]#Account# and [.object]#Contact# objects:

* The standard [.object]#Account Contact Relationship# object. To use this object, users should have the link:https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.shared_contacts_set_up.htm&type=5[ability to relate a contact to multiple records].
* When using the CT Pharma solution as the target system, [.apiobject]#CTPHARMA\__Reference__c# .
* Any custom object with the lookup field to the [.object]#Account# and [.object]#Contact# objects.

NOTE: If the incorrect object specified in the *Reference Object API Name* field, the field is considered empty.

The [.object]#Reference# object, as well as enabled or not xref:ios/admin-guide/person-accounts.adoc[Person Accounts], affects the record display.
