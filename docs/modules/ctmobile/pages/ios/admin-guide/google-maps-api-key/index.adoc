= Google Maps API Key

A Google Maps API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a
project making a call to the enabled API or SDK.



For building link:ios/routes[routes] and displaying
link:ios/nearby-accounts[nearby accounts] in the CT Mobile app, specify
the Google Maps API key according to your device platform on the
link:ios/ct-mobile-control-panel-general[CT Mobile Control Panel:
General]/link:ios/ct-mobile-control-panel-general-new[CT Mobile Control
Panel 2.0: General] tab. To obtain the Google Maps API key, go to

=== Create a Billing Account

Before you start using the Google Maps Platform APIs and SDKs:

* sign in if you already have a billing account;
* sign up and create a billing account if you are a new user.

To create a billing account, go to step 1 of the
https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started[Get Started with
Google Maps Platform] guide or refer to the video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uINleRduCWM[How to create and attach a
billing account to a Google Cloud Platform project].

It is possible
to https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/manage-billing-account[create&#44;
modify&#44; or close your Cloud Billing Account] and to have several
billing accounts.

=== Create a Project

The project is the basis for managing services, credentials, billing,
APIs, and SDKs. Project usage costs (for Google Cloud Platform and
Google Maps Platform products) will be charged to the billing account
linked with the project.

To create a project, go to step 2 of the
https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started[Get Started with
Google Maps Platform] guide, or follow the instructions
https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects[here].

It is
possible https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project[to
assign or remove a billing account for the existing project].

=== Get an API Key

For using APIs and SDKs, it is necessary to obtain a Google Maps API
key. To get, add, and restrict the API key, go to step 4 of the
https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started[Get Started with
Google Maps Platform] guide, refer to the video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_HZObVbe-g[How to generate and restrict
API keys for Google Maps Platform], or follow instructions
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/get-api-key[here]
for iOS devices and
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial[here]
for web sites.

API key is unique for each bundle ID.

Google recommends restricting the API key. Restrictions provide added
security and help ensure only authorized requests are made with your API
key.

ifdef::ios[][TIP] ==== Since Google changed the restriction
settings, and now users cannot restrict Directions API by using the
bundle identifier, we kindly ask you _not to set any restrictions_ in
order to be able to build routes in the CT Mobile app. ====

Select the condition and APIs to restrict the Google Maps API key.

. Application restrictions:
* *None*, if the restrictions are not applied.
* *HTTP referrers (websites)*. Accept requests from the list of websites
that you supply.
* *IP Addresses (web services, cron jobs, etc.)*. Accept requests from
the list of web server IP addresses that you supply.
* *Android apps*. Require package name and SHA-1 signing certificate
fingerprint to restrict usage to Android applications.
* *iOS apps*. Accept requests from the iOS applications with
link:ios/mobile-application-bundle-id[the bundle identifier] that is
supplied.

[.onfluence-information-macro-information]# If you need to enforce more
than one restriction, add a separate key with the required restriction.
#
. API restrictions

API restrictions limit the usage of the API key to one or more APIs or
SDKs. Requests to an API or SDK not associated with the API key will
fail.

The setup is complete. Now, you can use your Google Maps API Key to
build routes and find nearby accounts in the CT Mobile app.
