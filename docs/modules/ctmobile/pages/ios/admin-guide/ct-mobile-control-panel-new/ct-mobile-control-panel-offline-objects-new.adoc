= CT Mobile Control Panel 2.0: Offline Objects

The *Offline Objects* tab is intended for managing offline objects
(objects that should be available on the mobile app) and standard
related lists.

Related List] record type.

in the link:ios/ctm-settings[CTM Settings] with the _Offline Object_
record type.

In the left part:

* Use the search box to find offline objects in the *Available* list.
* Use the *Show Advanced List* option to display all objects in
the *Available* list, regardless of whether the object has a page
layout.
[NOTE] ==== Objects with the[.apiobject]#clm__ ====
prefix and _Library_ objects are not displayed in the list and should be
added as modules in the
link:ios/ct-mobile-control-panel-app-menu-new[App Menu]. #

* Click the object name in the *Selected* list to set up the user's
permissions to work with this object and standard related lists.​

=== Related Lists

On this tab, you can configure related lists for selected record type:

* In the *Allowed to* section, restrict the profile permissions to
create or delete records of the standard related lists, which are added
to the page layout of an offline object and available for the selected
record type.
* Click *Add Filter* to set up SOQL filters for using a toggle in the CT
Mobile app to display all records or only records that match the
criteria.
* ​Toggle the *Display as Timeline* to enable the
link:ios/timeline-view[timeline view]. If enabled, select a field
from the *Ordered by Selected Field* list.



To configure a related list, first select a record type from the list.

If a record has no custom record type associated with it, then the
_Master_ record type will be used.

Click image:ctm-control-panel-new-expand-icon.png[] to
view settings of the desired related list. Click *Expand All* to view
settings of all related lists.

If the record type has a link:ios/mobile-layouts[mobile layout],
related lists added to this layout will be displayed. Otherwise, related
lists of general layout will be displayed, according to the record
type.

[[h2__1623789156]]
=== Filter

Click *Add Filter* to set up a SOQL filter for the offline object. The
records of an offline object will be downloaded to the CT Mobile app
according to the filter conditions. If no filter is set, all records
available to the user will be downloaded. Using a filter is beneficial
as it reduces sync time and ensures only relevant records are available
in the mobile app.
