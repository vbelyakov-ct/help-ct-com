= Conflict Manager Control

Enable *Conflict Manager* to track the changes made in a single record
in CT Mobile and on the Salesforce side based on the date of the last
synchronization and the date in the[.apiobject]#SystemModStamp#
attribute of a record.

The record's field was changed on the Salesforce side if the date in the
[.apiobject]#SystemModStamp# attribute was later than the last
synchronization date. In this case, if a record's field in the mobile
application was changed too, a user will be asked to choose the correct
version of this field during the synchronization.

If the *Conflict Manager* is disabled, the changes made in CT Mobile
will replace the changes made on the Salesforce side.



The *Conflict Manager* can be enabled for each object separately. To
enable the Conflict Manager:

of the record in CT Mobile and on the Salesforce side, they can select a
correct version of the fields' value to keep.

*Done* to keep the record.
* Tap *Sync* to keep the mobile record.
* Tap *Cancel* to cancel the synchronization process.
