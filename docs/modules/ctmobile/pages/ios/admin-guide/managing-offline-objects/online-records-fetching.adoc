= Online Records Fetching

Set up xref:ios/admin-guide/managing-offline-objects/index.adoc[SOQL filters for the appropriate offline object] to speed up synchronization. Enable *Online Records Fetching* to allow users to load additional records via the *Load more records* button in the application.

* Records should be available for the current user and xref:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/related-list-filters.adoc[not downloaded according to SOQL filters].
* This option is not available for the number of xref:ctorders:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/order-change-manager/index.adoc[CT Orders objects]. If turned on, the synchronization will result in an error.

The records are synchronized.

If a current user launches xref:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/synchronization-launch/index.adoc[synchronization], the loaded records via *Online Records Fetching* will be still available on a mobile device. Records will be removed only after the xref:ios/mobile-application/application-settings/log-out.adoc[database reset].
