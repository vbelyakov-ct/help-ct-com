=== Important Notes

* A dashboard reflects only the records, which are loaded to the mobile
device.
* https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.dashboards_add_component.htm&type=5[A
dashboard must be created in Salesforce Classic].
* A dashboard should be located in a custom folder, not in a default
package folder.
* A user profile must have at least *View* permissions for the objects
used in the report.
* Proper sharing settings with users and roles must be configured for
the report and dashboard folders.
* Note that using the *Fiscal year* criterion in filters and reports and
dashboards criteria is working as the *Calendar year*.
* If you create dashboard based on a custom report, which uses custom
_Report Types_, only _with_ type conditions are supported for related
objects, _with or without_ type conditions are not supported.
