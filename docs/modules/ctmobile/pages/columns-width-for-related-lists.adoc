=== Important Notes

Please read the best practices for the Sync Recovery setting.

* The 0 value means that the column is not affected by width setting,
i.e., it will occupy the rest of the working area.
* The 100 value means that the column will squeeze out all the other
columns from the working area.
* If the total sum of values is greater than 100, then the columns'
widths setting is not applied to the related list.
* If the total sum of values is less than 100, the rest percentages are
divided into the number of columns and added to the width value of each
column.
* If the setting is applied only to some columns, and the total sum of
values is less than 100, the rest percentages are spread evenly among
the non-configured columns.
* The setting can take a value of an integer between 0 and 100. If this
requirement is not met, the setting is not applied.
