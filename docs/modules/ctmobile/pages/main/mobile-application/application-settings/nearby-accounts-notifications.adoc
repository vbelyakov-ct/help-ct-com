= Nearby Accounts Notifications

CT Mobile can notify the users when they are
xref:ctmobile:main/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/nearby-accounts.adoc[near an account from the database] depending
on the user's current geolocation (refer to
xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-general.adoc#h3_612123135[CT Mobile Control
Panel:
General]/xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-general-new.adoc#h3_612123135[CT
Mobile Control Panel 2.0: General]). This functionality is implemented
based on standard iOS platform features, which allows requesting the
user's current geolocation every 10 minutes.



If the user has changed their geolocation to more than 1 km during a
given period, a mobile device sends geolocation data to the CT Mobile
app. The application calculates the distance to the nearest accounts. If
within a 500 m radius at least one account is detected, a notification
will appear.

. In device settings, allow CT Mobile to access location and send
notifications.
[NOTE] ==== Select *Always* type of geolocation access
permission. ====
. Enable Wi-Fi.

[.confluence-information-macro-information]# With LTE on select iPad

The setup is complete.
