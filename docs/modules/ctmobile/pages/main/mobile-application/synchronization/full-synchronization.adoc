= Full Synchronization

To run full synchronization, long tap the *Sync* button in the top right
corner of the xref:ctmobile:main/mobile-application/ui/home-screen/index.adoc[Home Screen] and select *Full
synchronization* from the picklist.

//tag::ios[][NOTE] ==== Due to the
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_background[iOS
platform limitations], do not collapse the application and do not turn
off the screen during the first or full synchronization.  ====

* The full synchronization is triggered when you run your first
synchronization.
* During the full synchronization except for the first full
synchronization, the application is locked.
* The full synchronization process will be interrupted in case of
errors.

=== Sync Steps

. Data changes in the application such as deletions, insertions, and
updates are sent to Salesforce.
The step is skipped during the first full synchronization because the
database is empty.
. The changes in xref:clm-user[the audit fields] of the current
user record are sent to Salesforce.

[NOTE] ==== The change of the
[.apiobject]#clm__LastSyncDate__c ==== field will be
updated only if the previous synchronization was successful, but has
been interrupted before the field sync date was updated. #
. xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/metadata-checker/metadata-archive/index.adoc[Metadata components] are downloaded.
//tag::ios,win[]Metadata components are downloaded from ZIP
archive(s) or directly using administrator credentials depending
on xref:ct-mobile-managed-package-update-to-v-3-54[the CT Mobile
package version]. The cloud token should be valid to retrieve components
from the ZIP archive(s) (refer
to xref:ct-mobile-control-panel-tools#h3_2011978[CT Mobile Control
Panel: Tools]/xref:ct-mobile-control-panel-tools-new#h2_2011978[CT
Mobile Control Panel 2.0: Tools]). The synchronization process can
proceed without a valid cloud token or administrator credentials, and in
that case, xref:validation[validation rules], offline reports, and
some operators in formulas might not operate properly.
//tag::andr[]Metadata components are downloaded using valid
administrator credentials. The synchronization process can proceed

. The current data model:
* is created in case of *the first full synchronization*.
* is replaced by the newly updated in case of *full synchronization*.
. Records of xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/index.adoc[the custom settings&#44; custom
metadata types], xref:managing-offline-objects[offline objects],
and objects, which are necessary for activated
xref:ctmobile:main/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/index.adoc[modules], are downloaded if a
record matches the conditions set in
xref:related-list-filters[related list filters].
. xref:clm-user[The audit fields] of the current user record are
updated:

[NOTE] ==== The
[.apiobject]#clm__LastSyncDate__c ==== field will be
updated only if the first full or full synchronization was successful.
