= Fast Synchronization

To run fast synchronization, tap the *Sync* button in the top right
corner of the xref:ctmobile:main/mobile-application/ui/home-screen/index.adoc[Home Screen] or long tap the *Sync*
button and select *Fast synchronization* from the picklist.

//tag::ios[][NOTE] ==== Due to
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/scenes/preparing_your_ui_to_run_in_the_background[the
iOS platform limitations], do not collapse the application and do not
turn off the screen during fast or mixed synchronization. ====

* The mixed synchronization will be launched if certain conditions are
met.
* The fast and mixed synchronization processes are not interrupted in
case of errors with records. The unsynchronized records containing
errors can be synchronized after the errors are corrected.
* During the fast or mixed synchronization, the application is available
for work except for the *Applications* module.

=== Sync Steps

Data changes in the application, such as deletions, insertions, and
updates, are sent to Salesforce.

The changes in xref:clm-user[the audit fields] of the current
user's record are sent to Salesforce.

[NOTE] ==== The
[.apiobject]#clm__LastSyncDate__c ==== field will be
updated only if the previous synchronization was successful, but has
been interrupted before the field sync date was updated. #

//tag::ios[]

If enabled, records with errors will be sent using
xref:sync-recovery[the Sync Recovery functionality].

//tag::ios,win[]

The system compares the date of the last successful synchronization in
the[.apiobject]#clm__LastSyncDate__c# field of the
current user's record with the date of the last metadata change in the
[.apiobject]#clm__MetadataLastModifiedDate__c# field of
the xref:mobile-application-setup[Mobile Application Setup] record
for the current user's profile (if this record exists) or for the
current user's Salesforce organization. To find out how to manually or
automatically update
the [.apiobject]#clm__MetadataLastModifiedDate__c# field,
go to xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/metadata-checker/index.adoc[Metadata Checker].

* If the date of the last metadata change is a date earlier than the
date of the last successful synchronization, the application runs *the
fast synchronization*;
* If the date of the last metadata change is later than the date of the
last successful synchronization or not specified, the application runs
*the mixed synchronization* to download
xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/metadata-checker/metadata-archive/index.adoc[metadata components] and update the current
database.
Metadata components are downloaded from ZIP archive(s) or directly using
administrator credentials depending
on xref:ct-mobile-managed-package-update-to-v-3-54[the CT Mobile
package version]. The cloud token should be valid to retrieve components
from the ZIP archive(s) (refer to
xref:ct-mobile-control-panel-tools#h3_2011978[CT Mobile Control
Panel: Tools]/xref:ct-mobile-control-panel-tools-new#h2_2011978[CT
Mobile Control Panel 2.0: Tools]). The synchronization process can
proceed without a valid cloud token or administrator credentials, and in
that case, xref:validation[validation rules], offline reports, and
some operators in formulas might not operate properly.

Records of xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/index.adoc[the custom settings&#44; custom
metadata types], xref:managing-offline-objects[offline objects],
and objects, which are necessary for activated
xref:ctmobile:main/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/index.adoc[modules], are downloaded if the
value in the[.apiobject]#SystemModstamp# field is a date later
than the date of the last successful synchronization and a record
matches the conditions set in xref:related-list-filters[related
list filters].

//tag::ios[]

If configured, the records of the specified objects mentioned in the
xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/custom-settings/ct-mobile-replication.adoc[CT Mobile Replication] setting are
updated.

xref:clm-user[The audit fields] of the current user record are
updated.

[NOTE] ==== The
[.apiobject]#clm__LastSyncDate__c ==== field will be
updated only if fast/mixed synchronization was successful or partially
successful. This field shows that the actual information is downloaded
on the device. #
