=== Sync Log Records

//tag::ios,win,andr[]

The *Sync Log* record is created for each synchronization and each
operation, such as login, create, etc., after the synchronization
completion or interruption due to sync errors.

[TIP] ==== For more information, refer to
xref:sync-log[Sync Log]. ====

For example, if you performed the successful fast synchronization with
the insert operation of *Account* and *Contact* records and the update
operation of the *User* record, the following *Sync Log* records per
each operation will be created:

* The summary *Sync Log* record for the selected synchronization type:
** Operation: *Fast Sync*
** Status: *Success*
** Date
** Duration
** Description: *Part 1 from 1*
** The number of transmitted records
** The number of errors occurred.

The summary *Sync Log* record has the attachment which stores the text
file with the sync logs:
** Name: *syncSingle.log*
** ParentId which stores the ID of the summary Sync Log record
** Description: *Part 1 from 1*.
* ​The *Sync Log* record with the insert operation of *Account* record:
** Operation: *Insert*
** Status
** Object Name: *Account*
** Date
** Duration
** The number of transmitted records for the object
** The number of errors that occurred
** Failed messages
** Failed IDs.
* ​The *Sync Log* record with the insert operation of the *Contact*
record.
* ​The *Sync Log* record with the update operation of the *User* record.
