= Publishing CLM Presentations

When all the necessary information is placed on slides and widgets, the
CLM presentation is ready to publish. Publication of the CLM
presentation is a confirmation for all changes to be visible to the
users of the CT Mobile app and a command for the CT Mobile app to upload
an updated CLM presentation.

be loaded that have been updated after the last synchronization.

==== Renew Slides

//tag::ios,win[] To view slides in the navigation feed on the
xref:applications[Applications] module, on
xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/mobile-layouts/index.adoc-applications[the mobile layout] of a record,
xref:ctmobile:main/mobile-application/ui/home-screen/index.adoc[Home Screen], or during a co-browsing session with
the *Remote Detailing* functionality, it is necessary to take slide
screenshots. The *Renew Slides* functionality creates or replaces the
screenshots, for example, if some information was changed or the
animation was added. Taking a slide screenshot with a delay helps to
capture all animating details. Also, if you want to enable or disable
the *xref:creating-application-record[Available for Download]*
option, use the *Renew slides* function to apply this option.
