presentations

=== Common Recommendations

//tag::ios,win[]

Consider the quantity and image quality of the media assets to ensure
the CT Mobile app responds quickly, and the user does not wait long
during the synchronization or slide transition in the *Remote Detailing*
meetings.

[TIP] ==== It is important to test the CLM presentations for the
*Remote Detailing* meetings on different mobile devices to ensure
compatibility across device versions as well as cross-browser
compatibility. For more information, read
xref:remote-detailing-f-a-q[Remote Detailing F.A.Q].  ====
//tag::andr[]

Consider the quantity and image quality of the media assets to ensure
the CT Mobile app responds quickly, and the user does not wait
long xref:ctmobile:main/mobile-application/synchronization/index.adoc[during the synchronization].

The CLM presentation aspect ratio should depend on the screens of the
mobile device to display, mostly it is 16:9 or 4:3.

//tag::ios[]

Media is displayed full screen with a resolution 2048x1536 px for iPad
Retina (non-PRO version) and 1024×768 px for non-retina iPad.

ARKit models are supported.

//tag::andr,win[]

Use media according to the resolution of the target device.



HTML5 can handle large files, but you should make sure that these files
do not use all the memory of a mobile device. Otherwise, CT Mobile may
crash while displaying the content or soon after returning to the rest
of CT Mobile functionality.

* XML parsing within HTML5, while it may be technically possible, has
been known to use up all the memory.
* We recommend testing the display of HTML5 content and interactions
with it repeatedly to ensure memory issues will not occur. However,
memory warnings may appear in the device log to identify possible memory
issues, although not every time.
* For long-format, like reports and articles, we recommend using PDF
that may be xref:creating-clm-presentation-from-pdf[converted into
HTML5 code].
* For short-format media, HTML5 will provide a better navigation
experience, more accurate reporting, and interactivity.
* Also, it is possible to convert[.apiobject]#.ppt(x)# or
[.apiobject]#JPG/JPEG# into HTML5 code with slide snapshots
(degraded resolution is used to optimize image/file size).



We recommend that you consider default gestures when implementing custom
actions. For example, do not override the two-finger swipe that is used
to switch slides in a scenario. Or do not implement custom action by
double-tapping the sides of a screen because this gesture calls out the
navigation bar or the standard action menu.

* Adobe Flash is not supported.
* Do not name methods as the top-level domains. For example, if the
[.apiobject]#.to# method is used in the class on the slide
markup, the[.apiobject]#classname.to# will be interpreted as
the link.

==== Recommended Media Formats

[width="100%",cols="20%,20%,20%,20%,20%",]
|===
|*Type* |*Extension* |*Recommended Size* |*Display (on Mobile Device)*
|*Additional Guidelines*

|HTML5 a|
* .html
* .htm

a|
* 13 000 symbols per slide
* 2 MB

|Fullscreen in the landscape view a|
Support files such as HTML, CSS, images, video, and PDF are stored in
multiple folders.

Media included with the HTML should be referenced using relative paths,
like[.apiobject]#/css/styles.css# rather than
[.apiobject]#http://server.com/css/styles.css#.

xref:gestures-in-clm-presentations[Default gestures] to switch and
interact with slides are supported.

//tag::ios[]

Overriding the two-finger swipe and double-tap gesture is not supported.

|Video a|
* .mp4
* .m4v
* .mov
* .avi

|10 MB per video 60 seconds long a|
* Fullscreen in landscape view

a|
//tag::ios[]

Videos must be playable in the iPad video player or the video player of
the target device.

H.264 MPEG4 is recommended.

Large files increase the battery use of the device during syncing: using
the highest level of video compression that creates the desired effect
is strongly recommended.

|Images a|

In the current version of CT Presenter, PDFs are displayed only as
attachments on mobile devices.

Do not insert any fields or forms in PDF files.

If a PDF file contains any interactive elements, such as videos, gifs,
and links, they will not be available in the converted CLM presentation.

Do not use the *&* symbol in the PDF file name, otherwise the
presentation will not be loaded.

ifndef::andr[]

For presentations in xref:ctmobile:main/ct-presenter/the-remote-detailing-functionality/index.adoc[Remote
Detailing], we recommend using HTML5 or images instead of PDF.

characters, layout, and styling of the document won't change while

* If a [.apiobject]#.ppt(x)# file contains any interactive
elements, such as videos, gifs, and links, they will not be available in
the converted CLM presentation.
* ​Slides animation from converted [.apiobject]#.ppt# files is
not supported.

=== PDF and PowerPoint Requirements

Consider these parameters when converting CLM presentation based on
[.apiobject]#.pdf# or[.apiobject]#.ppt(x)#.



[width="100%",cols="20%,20%,20%,20%,20%",]
|===
|*Parameter* |*Image Size, pixels* |*Default Rendering Quality, DPI*
|*Physical Size, in* |*Physical Size, cm*

|*Width* |4096 |300 |13.65 |34.67

|*Height* |3072 |300 |10.24 |26.00

|*Width* |4800 |300 |16 |40.64

|*Height* |3600 |300 |12 |30.48
|===



For the[.apiobject]#.ppt(x)# format, these parameters mean the
slide size:

image:pptx-size.png[]

The slide size for the [.apiobject]#.ppt(x)# format was tested
and is recommended as a workable value. Presentations with other sizes
of .ppt(x) slides may not work properly.

local repository for offline access. The code for correct video
insertion in slide markup:
