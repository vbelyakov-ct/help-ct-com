= CRM Data Display

If the CLM presentation is launched on the *Activity* record, it is
possible to display values from the records related to the *Activity*
record. You can create, insert, update, or delete CRM data.



The common use cases:

* CLM presentation personalization.
* â€‹Create[.object]#Activity Data# for[.object]#Order
Taking# or[.object]#Stock-Taking#.
* Create contacts on a slide.
* Displaying of required data using markers in the
[.apiobject]#{!Object.Field}# format.



The label markups should be in the
[.apiobject]#{!CTPHARMA__Activity__c.Id}# format.

The following label must be placed in the slide markup, and the
JavaScript file connected to the slide had to refer to that variable.



For example, use the xref:ctmobile:main/ct-presenter/js-bridge-api/methods-for-interaction-with-crm-data/ctm-query.adoc[ctm.query] method on the slide
markup to display the record of the parent object:



Or you can display child records of the *Activity* record:
