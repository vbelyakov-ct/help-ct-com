The CT Presenter app for iPad is a solution of the CT Products family
that is intended to facilitate remote interactions between the sales
presenter and clients (HCPs, buyers) to achieve the most engaging user
experience.



With the invite link, participants of the
xref:ctmobile:main/ct-presenter/the-remote-detailing-functionality/index.adoc[Remote Detailing] meeting
could enter the meeting via the CT Presenter app installed on their
devices and, according to the permissions, perform actions, such as
stream video and audio, like/dislike slides, or answer the questions on
a slide.
