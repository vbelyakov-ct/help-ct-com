= Reference Fields

//tag::ios,win[]

https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/field_types.htm#stq=lookup&stp=1[A
reference field] contains an ID value that points to a unique record on
another object. The main record may be associated with a record in the
reference field via a lookup or master-detail relationship.



For the reference field, a mobile user can:

* xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/managing-offline-objects/reference-fields.adoc#h2_1514470758[download additional
record] if the reference field refers to the not downloaded record;
* xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/managing-offline-objects/reference-fields.adoc#h2_1554731138[search value] or create a
new record to add;
* use xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/managing-offline-objects/reference-fields.adoc#h2_321327715[lookup filters] to see
records that match required or optional criteria.

[[h2_1514470758]]
=== Online One Record Fetching

Along with xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/managing-offline-objects/online-records-fetching.adoc[online records fetching], a
mobile user can download one additional record
tappingimage:62573543.png[]next
to the field, which refers to the not downloaded
record, on xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/mobile-layouts/index.adoc[the mobile layout] of the linked
record.


Online one record fetching is available when:

* one of the downloaded records is linked to a not downloaded record;
* the object of the not downloaded record is
available xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/managing-offline-objects/index.adoc[offline].



For example, an _Activity_ record has a lookup field with
the _Contact_ record value and another lookup field with
the _Account_ record value. The linked record of
the [.object]#Contact# object was downloaded on a mobile device,
but the linked record of the [.object]#Account# object is not
available offline due to xref:related-list-filters[Related List
Filters]. When a mobile user opens the _Activity_ record, they can open
the available related _Contact_ record and download
the related _Account_ record to the mobile device.

To download a record:

. Open the desired record that is associated with the not downloaded
record.
. Tapimage:62573543.png[] next
to the reference field.
. Tap *Yes* to download the record.

The record is synchronized. The mobile layout of the record opens.

* If a current user launches xref:synchronization-launch[one of the
synchronization modes], the loaded record via online one record fetching
will still be available on a mobile device. The record will only be
removed after the database is reset.
* If the record's object is not available offline, a mobile user cannot
download a record.
* A mobile user can clear value from the reference field by tapping on a
field with the record and then tapping the *Clear* button.
* If xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/managing-offline-objects/index.adoc#h2_1534686659[a record in the
reference field was deleted] in the CT Mobile app,
the image:deleted.png[] icon
next to the reference field will be shown.

=== Online record search

Enter a record in the reference field xref:ctmobile:main/mobile-application/ui/home-screen/search.adoc[using search].

[[h2_321327715]]
=== Lookup Filters

Lookup filters restrict the valid values and lookup dialog results
for the reference field. To create a lookup filter, refer
to https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.fields_lookup_filters_defining.htm&type=5[Salesforce
Help].

//tag::ios,win[]

If you created or changed the lookup filter, it is necessary to
rebuild xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/metadata-checker/metadata-archive/index.adoc[a metadata
archive] using xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/metadata-checker/index.adoc[one of the available
options] to download the proper lookup filters via synchronization.

Lookup filter can be required or optional:

[[h3_107740449]]
==== Required filter

Only the records that match the lookup filter criteria are available
when a user fills out the reference field.

//tag::ios[]

image:required-lookup-filter.png[]

//tag::win[]

image:66368057.png[]



//tag::ios[]

If the created record doesn't match the filter criteria, the lookup
field will be empty and the corresponding message will be displayed:

image:record-doesnot-match-filter-criteria.png[]

[[h3_532834476]]
==== 

[[h3_532834476]]
==== Optional filter

All object records are available when a user fills out the reference
field. Records that do not match the lookup filter criteria are
highlighted in red color.

//tag::ios[]

image:optional-lookup-filter.png[]

//tag::win[]

image:66368058.png[]

[[h3_1126072765]]
==== Limitations on Lookup Filters

* Filter logic with subconditions is not supported. For example, such
filter logic will not work:

(Condition 1) OR ((Condition 2) AND (Condition 3))


In turn, this filter condition will work:

(Condition 1) OR (Condition 2) AND (Condition 3)
* Cross objects are not supported. For example, such object
specification will not work:
[.apiobject]#Territory: Region: Channel#

In turn, this object specification will work:
[.apiobject]#Account: Channel#
