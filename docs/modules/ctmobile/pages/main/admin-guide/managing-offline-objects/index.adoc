=== Set up Permissions to Offline Objects and Standard Related Lists

[NOTE] ==== These settings cannot overcome the user's profile
permissions. ====

To set up permissions for the offline object:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|In CT Mobile Control Panel a|
. Click the offline object in the *Selected* list. The *Object
Permissions* options appear on the right side of the screen.
. In the *Object Permissions* section, use toggles to grant permission
to create and delete records of the offline object.
* This permission will not affect the ability to create or delete a
record of the current object in the *Related Lists* section of another
offline object. For example, if you restricted the creation of
a *Contact* record in the *Object Permission* section, you may allow
creating the *Contact* records in the *Related Lists* section of
the [.object]#Account# object.
* {blank}
. In the *Related Lists* section:
* Select the record type of the offline object from the drop-down list
of record types available for the user profile.
