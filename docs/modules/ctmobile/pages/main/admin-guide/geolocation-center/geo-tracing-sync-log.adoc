= Geo Tracing Sync Log

When the user performed the first synchronization, the *Sync Log* record
for the *Geo Tracing* operation will be created.



According to the tracking interval (refer to
xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-general.adoc#h3_1808523151[CT Mobile
Control Panel:
General]/xref:ctmobile:main/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-general-new.adoc#h3_1808523151[CT
Mobile Control Panel 2.0: General]), CT Mobile monitors the user's
coordinates. If the user has changed their location, the coordinates
will be saved in the[.apiobject]#clm__GeoTracing__c#
field, and the time will be saved in the
[.apiobject]#clm__GeoTiming__c# field. If the user has
not changed their location, the fields will not be updated.



Once a day, the *Sync Log* record for the *Geo Tracing* operation will
be sent to Salesforce. If a *Sync Log* record is already stored on the
server, it will be downloaded from Salesforce.

* The *Sync Log* record stores the set of the user's coordinates
captured on the current user's local time according to the tracking
interval.
* The received coordinates per user's local time are used to build a
route on xref:using-geolocation-center#h2_1475553155[the Activities
tab] of the *Geolocation Center* tab.
