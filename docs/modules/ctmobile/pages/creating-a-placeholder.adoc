. Fill out the necessary fields.

[TIP] ==== The full description of placeholder attributes is
available link:clm-placeholder.html[here]. ====
* The *placeholder name* should include the CLM presentation name, e.g.,
_e-Detailing2: Test Template_, where _e-Detailing2_ is the name of the
CLM presentation.
* The placeholder position number is a required parameter.

On the template markup, placeholders are marked as
[.apiobject]#{!POSITION_n}#, where
[.apiobject]#n# is a position number. A widget that is
associated with this placeholder and that has the corresponding position
number in[.apiobject]#{! POSITION_n}# will be added to
the slide layout by the *Renew Slides* button on the CLM presentation
page.
* Specify a type of placeholder.
