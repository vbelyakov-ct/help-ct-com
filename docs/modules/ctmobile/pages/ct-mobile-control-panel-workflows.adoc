CT Mobile workflows allow managing the business logic of the mobile
application using no code. Workflow is a set of automated steps invoking
in a specified order and with specified criteria, and consists of two
objects:

* Workflow rule: describes the condition (trigger) of the
workflow. Available triggers:
** After updating an object.
** On Click—for interface objects.
* Workflow step: describes an action on a record(s). Available actions:

* Updating current record, parent record or related records.
* Creating new related record or parent record.
* Deleting related record or parent record.
* Capturing and updating geo-position of the current record, parent
record or related records.

[NOTE] ==== Workflow rules override application settings. For
example, if you apply a workflow to the *Start visit* button, the
parameters specified in the CT Mobile Control Panel (removing a geo
position, blocking a record or updating date fields) will not be
processed. ====
