=== Configure Data Dump Sending 

To configure data dump sending:

. Go to link:android/knowledge-base/configuration-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-general[CT Mobile Control
Panel: General].
. Select the required profile in the *Location* picklist.

[TIP] ==== *General Settings* will be applied to all the
profiles without individual settings. ====
. In the *Support and logs* field, enable *Sync Logs*.
. In the *Debug Level* field, select the appropriate option.
. In the *Send database dump to* field, select the appropriate way to
send the database dump.
* *Salesforce.com*

The ZIP archive with the data will be transferred as an attachment to
the link:android/sync-log[Sync Log] record. The size of the ZIP archive
cannot be larger than 25 MB. In case of exceeding the limit, the
database dump will be split into a few ZIP archives and each one will be
attached to its own *Sync Log* record.

[TIP] ==== To use this option,
link:android/knowledge-base/configuration-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-tools#h3_2011978[the cloud token]
should be valid. In the case the cloud token is not specified, the
password will be[.apiobject]#ctmobile ==== . #
* *E-mail*

Selecting this option, specify the email to send the data logs and
screenshots of synchronization errors in the *Support Email* field
