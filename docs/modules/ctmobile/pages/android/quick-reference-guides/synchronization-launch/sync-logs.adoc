=== Sync Log Records 

The *Sync Log* record is created for each synchronization and each
operation, such as login, create, etc., after the synchronization
completion or interruption due to sync errors.

[TIP] ==== For more information, refer to
link:android/quick-reference-guides/synchronization-launch/sync-log[Sync Log]. ====

For example, if you performed the successful fast synchronization with
the insert operation of *Account* and *Contact* records and the update
operation of the *User* record, the following *Sync Log* records per
each operation will be created:

* The summary *Sync Log* record for the selected synchronization type:
** Operation: *Fast Sync*
** Status: *Success*
** Date
** Duration
** Description: *Part 1 from 1*
** The number of transmitted records
** The number of errors occurred.

The summary *Sync Log* record has the attachment which stores the text
file with the sync logs:

** Name: *syncSingle.log*
** ParentId which stores the ID of the summary Sync Log record
** Description: *Part 1 from 1*.
* ​The *Sync Log* record with the insert operation of *Account* record:
** Operation: *Insert*
** Status
** Object Name: *Account*
** Date
** Duration
** The number of transmitted records for the object
** The number of errors that occurred
** Failed messages
** Failed IDs.
* ​The *Sync Log* record with the insert operation of the *Contact*
record.
* ​The *Sync Log* record with the update operation of the *User* record.

. Go to link:android/knowledge-base/configuration-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-general[CT Mobile Control
Panel: General].
. Select the required profile in the **Location **picklist.

[TIP] ==== *General Settings* will be applied to all profiles
without individual settings. ====
. In the *Support and logs* section, activate the *Enable Sync logs*
switch.
. In the *Debug Level* picklist, select the logging level:
* *None*. Logging is disabled.
* *Error*. A log entry is created only in case of occurred
synchronization error.
* *All*. Each synchronization is logged as a separate entry
irrespectively of whether it contains errors or not.

[WARNING] ==== Enabling the *All* option for a long time will
result in an overflow of the data storage at Salesforce and a
significant increase in the CT Mobile synchronization time. ====
