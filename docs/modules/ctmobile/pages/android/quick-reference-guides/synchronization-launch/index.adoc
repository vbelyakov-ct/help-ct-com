Salesforce, during which updated records are sent from CT Mobile to
Salesforce and vice versa.

=== Synchronization Modes 

For information about settings for tracking and gathering the
synchronization statistics, refer to xref:android/quick-reference-guides/synchronization-launch/sync-logs.adoc[Sync Logs].

[[h3_21591833]]
==== First Full Synchronization 

The entire database of the CT Mobile app,
xref:android/knowledge-base/configuration-guide/metadata-archive/index.adoc[metadata components], and app settings will
be downloaded from Salesforce to the mobile device.

* This synchronization should be used after xref:android/logging-in[the
authorization] of the current user.
* The first full synchronization may take a lot of time according to the
database size.

For more information, go to xref:android/knowledge-base/mobile-application/synchronization/full-synchronization[First Full
and Full Synchronization].

[[h3_1369866827]]
==== Full Synchronization 

The entire database of the CT Mobile app, metadata components, and app
settings will be replaced on the mobile device based on changes in
Salesforce.

Full synchronization may take a lot of time according to the database
size.

For more information, go to xref:android/knowledge-base/mobile-application/synchronization/full-synchronization[First Full
and Full Synchronization].

[[h3_116633872]]
==== Fast Synchronization 

Data changes, such as deletions, insertions, and updates of records,
will be sent from CT Mobile to Salesforce and vice versa.

* This type is intended to align the records' main information, for
example, to send new records from CT mobile app to Salesforce.
* The CT Mobile app will not be locked during the fast synchronization.

For more information, go to xref:android/knowledge-base/mobile-application/synchronization/fast-synchronization[Fast and
Mixed Synchronization].
