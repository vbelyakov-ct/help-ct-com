= Application Permission Settings

Pay attention that the profile settings may be displayed in two
different modes. For more information, go to
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.users_profiles_about_enhanced_ui.htm&type=5[Salesforce
Help].

CT Mobile users should be divided by their roles, for example, admins,
supervisors, and field forces. For this purpose, define profiles for
various user types and assign permission sets or use permission set
groups to extend user access. Also, manage sharing rules to define
access exceptions.

=== Profiles 

[WARNING] ==== We kindly ask you to set up a separate profile
for a user who configures the system. The user should have the _Modify
All Data_ and _Modify Metadata Through Metadata API Functions_
permission and access to all fields and objects. ====

To use xref:android/quick-reference-guides/home-screen#h3_1361691321[the mobile logo], a mobile
user should have access to the *Documents* folder. Please check the
following:

* At least permission to read the *Documents* object is assigned to the
mobile user.
* At least permission to read and edit the *Documents* object is
assigned to the administrator.
* The _CT CLM_ folder is
https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.creating_and_editing_folders.htm&type=5[accessible
by all users].

https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.admin_userprofiles.htm&type=5[A
profile] is an array of settings and permissions that define what a user
can do in the CT Mobile app.

* A profile controls object permissions, field permissions, user
permissions, tab settings, app settings, Apex class access, Visualforce
page access, page layouts, record types, login hours, and login IP
ranges.
* A profile can be assigned to many users, but a user can be assigned to
a single profile at a time.
* A user's profile should be specified on some
xref:android/knowledge-base/configuration-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/index.adoc[CT Mobile Control Panel] tabs to
define the required user's permissions.



There are two types of profiles:

* *Standard profiles* are provided by default. These profiles cannot be
deleted.
* *Custom profiles* are user-defined profiles. These profiles can be
deleted if no users are assigned to them.

[[h3_1485360783]]
==== Set Up a New Profile 

Define profiles by the user’s function. You can create and assign a new
profile to a user or change the profile for another one. Changing the
user's profile may cause access issues to records in the CT Mobile app
and errors during the synchronization.



For example, access to an object has been withdrawn from the mobile
user's profile after the last full synchronization. During the next fast
synchronization, the[.apiobject]#INVALID_TYPE# error may
occur because some records are no more available.



To create and set up a new profile:

. Go to**Setup → Users → Profiles**.


image:47745357.png[]
. Click *New Profile*.

[TIP] ==== Also, you can click *Clone* next to the desired
profile to copy all its settings to a new one. ====
. Select the *Existing Profile* from the drop-down list.
. Enter the new profile name and click *Save*.
. Click *Edit* and set up permissions.
. Click *Save*.

The profile is ready to use.

=== Permission Sets and Permission Set Groups 

A user can be assigned to a single profile at a time, but can also have
multiple permission sets.
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=perm_sets_overview.htm&type=5[A
permission set] is a collection of settings and permissions that give
users access to various tools and functions.

* A profile gives minimum permissions and settings access for a user or
specific user groups.
* A permission set extends a user's permissions and grants more access
without changing a user's profile.
* https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.perm_set_groups.htm&type=5[A
permission set group] helps to assign several permission sets together
based on user job functions. Users with assigned the permission set
group receive the combined permissions of all the permission sets in the
group.

[[h3_2115044027]]
==== Required Permission Sets 

[WARNING] ==== We kindly ask you to assign the preconfigured
permission sets to all users in your system according to their roles.
====

For your convenience, we create two permission sets that include
configured access to all required objects and fields depending on the
user type.

* _CT Mobile Administrator_ should be assigned to admins. It contains
all required permissions and access to all required Apex classes for the
correct operation of the CT Mobile package and CT Mobile app.
* _CT Mobile User_ should be assigned to users who will work with the CT
Mobile app as field forces, supervisors, etc. according to your business
purposes.

[[h2_1133416231]]
=== Sharing Rules 

https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.managing_the_sharing_model.htm&type=5[Sharing
rules] are used to control user access at the record level. Currently,
the CT Mobile app cannot correctly handle records with the *Public
Read-Only* access.



For example, the *Public Read-Only* access is specified for the
[.object]#Account# object, and the mobile user's profile has
permission to edit and delete records of the[.object]#Account#
object. In the CT Mobile app, the mobile user can edit and delete all
downloaded _Account_ records, but errors will occur during the
synchronization if the mobile user has deleted or edited records that
they do not own.

[[h2_631577805]]
=== Restriction Rules 

https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.security_restriction_rule.htm&type=5[Restriction
rules] are used to allow certain users to access only specified records.
They prevent users from accessing records that contain sensitive data or
information that isn’t essential to their work.



After setting restriction rules, the user does not see certain records
in Salesforce, and the same records will not be able to the user in the
CT Mobile after synchronization.
