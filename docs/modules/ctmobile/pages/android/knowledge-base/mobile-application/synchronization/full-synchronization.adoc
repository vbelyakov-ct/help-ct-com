=== Sync Steps 

. Data changes in the application such as deletions, insertions, and
updates are sent to Salesforce.

[TIP] ==== The step is skipped during the first full
synchronization because the database is empty. ====
. The changes in xref:android/clm-user[the audit fields] of the current
user record are sent to Salesforce.

[NOTE] ==== The change of the
[.apiobject]#clm__LastSyncDate__c ==== field will be
updated only if the previous synchronization was successful, but has
been interrupted before the field sync date was updated. #
. xref:android/knowledge-base/configuration-guide/metadata-archive/index.adoc[Metadata components] are downloaded.
[NOTE] ==== Metadata components are downloaded using valid
administrator credentials. The synchronization process can proceed
without valid administrator credentials, but
xref:android/knowledge-base/mobile-application/synchronization/validation[validation rules] offline reports, and some
operators in formulas might not operate properly.  ====
. The current data model:
* is created in case of *the first full synchronization*.
* is replaced by the newly updated in case of *full synchronization*.
. Records of xref:android/knowledge-base/configuration-guide/custom-settings/index.adoc[the custom settings&#44; custom
metadata types], xref:android/quick-reference-guides/managing-offline-objects.adoc[offline objects],
and objects, which are necessary for activated
xref:android/mobile-application-modules[modules], are downloaded if a
record matches the conditions set in
xref:android/knowledge-base/configuration-guide/custom-settings/related-list-filters[related list filters].
. xref:android/clm-user[The audit fields] of the current user record are
updated:

[NOTE] ==== The
[.apiobject]#clm__LastSyncDate__c ==== field will be
updated only if the first full or full synchronization was successful.
This field shows that the actual information is downloaded on the
