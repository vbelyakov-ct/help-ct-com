updates are sent to Salesforce.

[TIP] ==== The step is skipped during the first full
synchronization because the database is empty. ====
. The changes in link:android/clm-user[the audit fields] of the current
user record are sent to Salesforce.

[NOTE] ==== The change of the
[.apiobject]#clm__LastSyncDate__c ==== field will be
updated only if the previous synchronization was successful, but has
been interrupted before the field sync date was updated. #
. link:android/knowledge-base/configuration-guide/metadata-archive/metadata-archive[Metadata components] are downloaded.
[NOTE] ==== Metadata components are downloaded using valid
administrator credentials. The synchronization process can proceed
without valid administrator credentials, but
link:android/knowledge-base/mobile-application/synchronization/validation[validation rules] offline reports, and some
