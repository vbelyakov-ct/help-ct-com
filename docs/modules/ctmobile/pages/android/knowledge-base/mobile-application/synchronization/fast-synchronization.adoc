= Fast Synchronization

To run fast synchronization, tap the *Sync* button in the top right
corner of the xref:android/quick-reference-guides/home-screen.adoc[Home Screen] or long tap the *Sync*
button and select *Fast synchronization* from the picklist.

* The mixed synchronization will be launched if certain conditions are
met.
* The fast and mixed synchronization processes are not interrupted in
case of errors with records. The unsynchronized records containing
errors can be synchronized after the errors are corrected.
* During the fast or mixed synchronization, the application is available
for work except for the *Applications* module.

=== Sync Steps 

. Data changes in the application, such as deletions, insertions, and
updates, are sent to Salesforce.
. The changes in xref:android/clm-user[the audit fields] of the current
user's record are sent to Salesforce.

[NOTE] ==== The
[.apiobject]#clm__LastSyncDate__c ==== field will be
updated only if the previous synchronization was successful, but has
been interrupted before the field sync date was updated. #
. Records of xref:android/knowledge-base/configuration-guide/custom-settings/index.adoc[the custom settings&#44; custom
metadata types], xref:android/quick-reference-guides/managing-offline-objects.adoc[offline objects],
and objects, which are necessary for activated
xref:android/mobile-application-modules[modules], are downloaded if the
value in the [.apiobject]#SystemModstamp# field is a date later
than the date of the last successful synchronization and a record
matches the conditions set in xref:android/knowledge-base/configuration-guide/custom-settings/related-list-filters[related
list filters].
. xref:android/clm-user[The audit fields] of the current user record are
updated.

[NOTE] ==== The
[.apiobject]#clm__LastSyncDate__c ==== field will be
updated only if fast/mixed synchronization was successful or partially
successful. This field shows that the actual information is downloaded
on the device. #
