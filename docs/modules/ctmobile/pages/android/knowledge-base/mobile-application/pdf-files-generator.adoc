= PDF Files Generator

The CT Mobile app allows you to generate PDF documents during the
display of CLM presentations.



You can attach several templates to a single CLM presentation.

* templates should be added as an
xref:android/attachments-and-files[attachment] to the CLM presentation.
** The template *filename* should have the format as
[.apiobject]#template.html#,
[.apiobject]#template1.html#,
[.apiobject]#template0012.html#
** The template *name* should be specified in the *Description* field of
the[.object]#Attachment# object. The selected value will be
displayed in the list of templates available for generation.
* each template must contain markers of the following type:
[.apiobject]#{!Contact.FirstName}#,
[.apiobject]#{!Account.Name}#,
[.apiobject]#{!CustomObject__c.SomeField__c}#.
** At the document generation, markers will be replaced by the values of
the indicated fields of available offline objects.
** If a field is empty or the object of this field is not available
offline, the marker will be replaced by a blank space.

[NOTE] ==== The values are substituted from the local database
records, as well as the values collected during the display of a CLM
presentation. ====
