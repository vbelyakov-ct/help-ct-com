= CT Mobile Control Panel

*CT Mobile Control Panel* is a Salesforce interface for connecting the
CT Mobile solution to the customer's target system and for specifying
all the necessary settings to personalize the CT Mobile app.

A user configuring a CT Mobile solution must have a separate profile and
an assigned _link:application-permission-settings.html#h2__1046081510[CT
Mobile Administrator]_ permission set.

* All customizations for the selected profile will be saved in
link:android/custom-settings[custom settings] or as
link:android/ctm-settings[CTM Settings] records.
* Settings for link:android/ctm-settings-menu[menu],
link:android/ctm-settings-offline-objects[offline objects], and
link:android/ctm-settings-standard-related-list[standard related lists] on
the *CT Mobile Control Panel* are displayed based on the *CTM Settings*
records. Other settings are displayed according to the records of the
custom settings.
