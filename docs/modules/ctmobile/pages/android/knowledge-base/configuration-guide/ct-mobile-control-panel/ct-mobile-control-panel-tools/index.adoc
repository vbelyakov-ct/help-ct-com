=== Administrator Credentials 

[WARNING] ==== For users of CT Mobile package version below
3.54. ====

Specify the *Login*, *Password*, and *Token* fields. Please refer to the
xref:android/security-token[Security Token] article for additional
information.



CT Mobile receives xref:android/metadata-archive#h2_1854953360[metadata
components] within a ZIP archive. Administrator credentials should be
valid to retrieve metadata components from ZIP-archive.

* If the mobile user is the administrator, all data and metadata will be
downloaded directly.
* The synchronization process can proceed without using administrator
credentials and ZIP-archive with metadata components. In that case, some
functionality, for example, validation rules, will not operate properly.



The Administrator profile must have the _Modify All_ and _Modify
Metadata Through Metadata API Functions_ permission, the assigned
_xref:application-permission-settings.html#ApplicationPermissionSettings-PermissionSets[CT
Mobile Administrator]_ permission set, and access to all fields and
objects.

* It is highly recommended to set up a separate Administrator account
that would not be used elsewhere by anyone else. This will help to avoid
account lock-out in the future.
* It is recommended to turn off password expiration for the
Administrator profile, go to *Setup → Users → Profiles →* select the
required profile *→ Administrative Permissions →* set a flag next to
*Password Never Expires*.



Administrator credentials are stored encrypted in Salesforce. The
downloading of metadata during xref:android/synchronization[the
synchronization process] includes the following steps:

. User authorization, uploading the general settings.
. The _Modify All_ permission verification. If the user has the _Modify
All_ permission, all further requests are made on behalf of this user.
Otherwise, the system proceeds to the steps described below.
. If ZIP-archive with metadata components has been generated, the
application downloads it. Otherwise, the system proceeds to the next
step.
. Requesting the encrypted administrator credentials.
. Receiving the encrypted administrator credentials. The system attempts
to decrypt credentials and log in.
. If the authorization is successful, the system sends requests for
validation rules metadata and UserRole guide data. After that, the
session completes, and all further requests are sent on behalf of the
current user.
