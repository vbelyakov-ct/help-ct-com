= Publishing CLM Presentations

When all the necessary information is placed on slides and widgets, the
CLM presentation is ready to publish. Publication of the CLM
presentation is a confirmation for all changes to be visible to the
users of the CT Mobile app and a command for the CT Mobile app to upload
an updated CLM presentation.

After the publication is confirmed, the CLM presentation is marked as
*Active*, and the current version of the CLM presentation is updated.



During fast or mixed synchronization, the CT Mobile app compares the
current version of the CLM presentation with the one previously saved.
If any discrepancies are found, only those slides and attachments will
be loaded that have been updated after the last synchronization.

==== Renew Slides 

To view slides in the navigation feed on the
link:android/knowledge-base/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/applications/applications[Applications] module, on
link:android/mobile-layouts-applications[the mobile layout] of a record,
and link:android/home-screen[Home Screen], it is necessary to take slide
screenshots. The *Renew Slides* functionality creates or replaces the
screenshots, for example, if some information was changed or the
animation was added. Taking a slide screenshot with a delay helps to
capture all animating details.



Currently, the screenshots of slides that use the following HTML
features are taken incorrectly:

* csstransforms3d
* WebGL
* geolocation
* indexeddb
* video
* audio

The process of preparing slide screenshots may take up to 10-15 minutes,
depending on the current service load.



To renew slide screenshots:

[NOTE] ==== If
link:android/knowledge-base/ct-presenter/ct-presenter-introduction#h2_1251281241[the required remote
sites] are not activated, slides will not be updated and the error
message will be shown. ====

. Go to the *Applications* tab.
. Click the required CLM presentation.
. Click the *Renew Slides* button.
. Select the delay: 3, 7, or 15 seconds.

slides and branches. ====
