=== Integrated CLM and CRM 

CT Presenter enables client-facing interactions using CLM presentations
via various channels.

CLM presentations can include interactive product presentations,
educative and training materials, videos, references, links to external
websites, mini-applications for trade & retail audits, contract
visualization, etc.



As CT Presenter is tightly integrated with CT Mobile, CLM presentations
can interact with the mobile offline database of the CT Mobile app using
link:android/js-bridge-api[read/write access to CRM data]. In CLM
presentations, images, videos, and attached PDFs can be used from the
existing media libraries. For example, it is possible to develop complex
CLM presentations based on HTML5 for product presentation along with
retail audit and order taking. It will be a visually and functionally
advanced presentation, which can provide a full “route map” of a visit
and support with interactive tools for the actions that are needed to
take during the call.



CLM presentations are structured within the Salesforce data model and
store HTML5 content and related resources in the Salesforce database. CT
Presenter provides the data model and tools for
link:android/clm-applicationstats[CLM-presentations tracking and usage
analysis for further improvement], e.g., shown slides, duration of every
slide shown, clicks, etc. As all the statistics of content usage are
stored in the Salesforce database, it is easy to run reports and develop
integrated reports on CRM {plus} CLM performance indicators of the reps.
