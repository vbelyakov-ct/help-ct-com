The *Application Editor* allows creating CLM presentations from JPEG/JPG
files:

root level (do not use folders) in order to convert it to a separate
slide.

To convert the JPEG/JPG images into CLM presentation:

. Go to *Application Editor*.
. Select a CLM presentation from the picklist in the upper left corner,
click *New* to create a new CLM presentation, or click *Clone* to add a
new CLM presentation identical to the selected one.

For example, enter the name of a CLM presentation, define additional
settings, and click *OK* in the case of a new CLM presentation.
