Salesforce provides the ability to attach content to records in two
ways:

* Attach content to an object through a[.object]#Files# object
** Each file consists of a record of the[.object]#Content
Document# object that represents a document uploaded to Salesforce CRM
Content or Salesforce Files and a record of the
[.object]#Content Version# object that represents a version of
the uploaded document.
** A user or their organization must have access to
[.object]#Files#.
** If the user has access to an object but no access to the attached
content, all content will be in the *Notes & Attachments* section.
* Attach content as an[.object]#Attachment# to an object with
the enabled transfer of all records to the[.object]#Files#
object.



In Salesforce Classic, all documents are saved by default as a record of
the[.object]#Attachment# object in the *Notes & Attachments*
section. To save documents as[.object]#Files#:

. Go to *Setup → Feature Settings → Salesforce Files → General
Settings*.
. Enable the *Files uploaded to the Attachments related list on records
are uploaded as Salesforce Files, not as attachments* option.

Now, documents are saved as files in the *Notes & Attachments* section.



[.object]#Attachments# and[.object]#Files# are used to
store:

=== Downloading Attachments 

During the full synchronization, CT Mobile downloads attachments by
requesting the
https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.228.0.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_combinedattachment.htm[CombinedAttachments]
records for all offline objects.

* Each *CombinedAttachments* record contains a file link and file name.
* These records are stored in the *Notes & Attachments* section. When a
user taps the[.apiobject]#CombinedAttachment# record, the
attachment is downloaded.

[NOTE] ==== Do not add the[.object]#CombinedAttachments
==== object to offline objects.#

To upload attachments from the CT Mobile app to Salesforce, launch the
fast synchronization.
