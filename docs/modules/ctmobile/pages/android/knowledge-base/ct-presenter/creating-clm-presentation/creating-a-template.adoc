= Creating a Template

CT Presenter allows creating several slides based on one template.

* You can use xref:android/knowledge-base/ct-presenter/creating-clm-presentation/creating-a-widget[widgets] to make slides look
and feel different. To use widgets, it is needed to add
xref:android/knowledge-base/ct-presenter/creating-clm-presentation/creating-a-placeholder[placeholders] where they would be
located.
* Templates support an unlimited number of placeholders.



To create a template:

. Go to *Applications* and select a CLM presentation.
. Click *New* in the *Templates* section.

* To activate JS Bridge in the HTML code,
xref:android/activating-js-bridge[enable the JS Bridge library].
* The *template name* should include the CLM presentation name, e.g.,
_e-Detailing2: Test Template_, where _e-Detailing2_ is the name of the
CLM presentation.
