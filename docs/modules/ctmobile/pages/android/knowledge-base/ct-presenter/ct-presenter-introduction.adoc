During the synchronization process, CLM presentations will be downloaded
on the mobile device and available for use:

* The xref:android/clm-application[CLM presentation] should be active and
available offline.
[NOTE] ==== The *Available Offline* attribute is available since
the CT Mobile managed package v. 3.54. The administrator should activate
this checkbox for the required CLM presentations. ====
* xref:android/knowledge-base/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/applications/applications[The Application module] allows reviewing CLM
presentations uploaded from Salesforce.
* You can configure xref:android/mobile-layouts-applications[the mobile
layout] of the _Activity_ object to launch a CLM presentation from the
carousel of CLM presentations on the activity record.
* Also, you can launch a CLM presentation from the
xref:android/home-screen[Home Screen].



For each CLM presentation:

* Use pre-configured xref:android/knowledge-base/mobile-application/mobile-application-modules/applications/gestures-in-clm-presentations[gestures].
* Double-tap the left or right side of the screen to view the
https://help.customertimes.com/smart/project-ct-mobile-en/clm-presentation-controls[control

slide navigation are specified for each CLM presentation. The statistics
will be linked to the activity record from which it was started. The CT
Mobile app asks a user to link the statistics to the activity record if
