= Roll-up Summary Fields

A roll-up summary field is used to calculate values from a set of related records. The child records must be directly related to the parent record through a master-detail relationship.

To create a roll-up summary field, refer to https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.fields_about_roll_up_summary_fields.htm&type=5[Salesforce Help].

In the CT Mobile app, the roll-up field will be not automatically recalculated when a user changed values in the child records. Perform the synchronization to view the recalculated value.
