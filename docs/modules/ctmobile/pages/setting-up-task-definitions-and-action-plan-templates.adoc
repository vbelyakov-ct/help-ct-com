= Setting up Task Definitions and Action Plan Templates

Managers need to identify the broad task types that reps perform at
retail stores and set up metrics to measure store performance.

When a field rep visits a store, they performÂ certain activities related
to the different aspects of visit execution. The metrics are defined as
records of[.object]#Assessment Indicator Definitions#, and
targets are in place with *Retail Store KPIs*.

=== Create Action Plan Templates

An action plan template provides a framework to reuse tasks across
stores and visits. Each item in the action plan template refers to a
task definition. Each action plan template can have a different set of
required or not tasks.

An action plan template is a primary list of items. For Consumer Goods
Cloud, an action plan template can have more than one item with the same
assessment task definition.
