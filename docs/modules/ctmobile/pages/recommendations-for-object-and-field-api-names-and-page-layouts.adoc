=== Object and Field API Names

[WARNING] ==== Working in non-English Salesforce environments,
all settings should be specified in English. Use
https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.workbench.htm&type=5[Translation
Workbench] for translating all labels and other settings. ====

* Creating fields with identical API names inside a single object is not
allowed, even if their prefixes and postfixes are different. For
example,[.apiobject]#Name# and
[.apiobject]#Name__c# are considered as the same API name.
* https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=adding_fields.htm&type=5[All
API names] should be in English.
* Specify the short and meaningful name and avoid using Pidgin
English.
* Specify *Description* or *Help Text* to simplify the setup process and
reduce the time for preparing documentation.
* Start the API name with the capital letter. In the case of several
words, use the following format: [.apiobject]#CompanyName,
BillingDate, InvoiceNumber#.
* The dashes and underscores are restricted.
* Please avoid using numbers.
* Recommendations for specifying API names for fields with the specific
datatype:
** *Lookup Relationship* should contain the name of the object to link
and the[.apiobject]#Id# word, for example,
[.apiobject]#AccountId#,[.apiobject]#ContactId#. Also,
specify the plural name of the object in the *Child Relationship Field*,
for example,[.apiobject]#Activities#,
[.apiobject]#Orders#.
** The *checkbox* should contain the[.apiobject]#Is# or
[.apiobject]#Has# word, for example,
[.apiobject]#IsActive__c#, [.apiobject]#HasProducts__c#. ** For *Number*, *Text*, and *Text Area*, do not limit the *Length* field unless necessary. ** *Geoposition* is created in decimal format, with 6 decimal places. ** For *Auto Number*, it is required to specify variables in the *Display Format* field. For example, the following date format[.apiobject]#SF{000}-{DD}/{MM}/{YYYY}# returns
the[.apiobject]#SF021-13/05/2009# value.
** The deleted field API-name has
the [.apiobject]#_del# postfix. Be sure to remove this
postfix after recovery.

=== Page Layouts

Set up page layouts given the following:

* Fields with the *Text Area* or *Text Area Long* datatype should be
placed together in a separate section with a 1-column layout.

the *System Information* section.
* Fields with the *Number*, *Date*, and *Date/Time* datatype are placed
on the right side of the *Information* section.
* Manage *related lists* within the editing the corresponding page
layout.
