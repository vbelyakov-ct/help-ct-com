=== Important Notes

When you launch the *Remote Detailing* meeting in the CT Mobile app, CRM
data captured by JS Bridge will be uploaded to Salesforce and not stored
on the mobile device. A user should have permission to edit records of
the corresponding object. For example, if you create a new record using
[.apiobject]#ctm.create#, it will be uploaded to Salesforce, and
you should launchÂ link:fast-synchronization.html[fast synchronization]
to download it to a mobile device.



When you open a CLM presentation in the *Application* module, from the
carousel of CLM presentations on the Home screen or mobile layout in the
CT Mobile app, CRM data captured by JS Bridge will be saved to the
mobile device. In this case, the corresponding object should be
available offline, and a user should have permission to edit its
records. To upload data to Salesforce, perform the fast synchronization.
