= Reassigning Access Rights After Changing Custom Tab

Applicable in cases of updating to CT CPG 1.19 or higher from any lower
version.

The custom tabs for package objects were introduced in CT CPG 1.19 and
require to reassign existing access rights to them.

Due to the CT CPG 1.19 update, there might be issues caused by custom
tabs that were manually created by administrators in previous CT CPG
package versions.



To reassign access rights:

. Copy the code below and save it as the .xml file.
* Change the CTCPG_ReportTemplate__c
and CTCPG_ChangeRequest__c values in the code below with the
object API names, for which the custom tabs were manually created by
administrators.
* Change 46.0 value in the code below with the required API version.

. https://workbench.developerforce.com/login.php[Go to the workbench]
and log in with credentials of the required Salesforce organization.
. Go to *Migration → Retrieve*
. Specify the path to your locally stored .xml file from step 1.
. Click *Next* → click *Retrieve*.
. When metadata is ready, click *Download ZIP File* in the *Results*
section and save the ZIP file.

. Open the .xml file from the downloaded archive and delete the custom
tabs from this Salesforce organization. 
. Go to the workbench to deploy new custom tabs from a new version.
. Go to **Migration → Retrieve **→ add the .xml file from step 1 →
click *Next* → click *Deploy*. 

When deployment is complete, the previously existed access rights will
be assigned to the newly deployed custom tabs.
