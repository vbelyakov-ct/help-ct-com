= Public Methods

Public means the method can be used by any Apex in this app or namespace
and be called by triggers and other classes. Calling methods of other
classes:

* enables code reuse;
* reduces the size of triggers;
* improves maintenance of Apex code;
* allows you to use object-oriented programming.



You can extend a class to provide more specialized behavior. A class
that extends another class inherits all the methods and properties of
the extended class. In addition, the extending class can override the
existing virtual methods by using the override keyword in the method
definition. Overriding a virtual method allows you to provide a
different implementation for an existing method. This means that the
behavior of a particular method is different based on the object youâ€™re
calling it on.

Currently, we have only one public method:

* The global GlobalActivityService class.
* The first parameter is the list of the _CT CPG Activity_ records.
* The second parameter is the previous values of the __CT CPG
Activity __records.



Here is an example of how to extend the existing class and override its
public method.
