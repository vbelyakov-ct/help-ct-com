= Enabling the Bypass Logic

The *Bypass Logic* functionality is intended to restrict the execution of one or several trigger methods by deactivating the specific trigger context(s) or methods.
To restrict execution of a method invoked by the trigger context:

. Go to *Setup → Custom Code → Custom Settings*.
. Click *Manage* next to *Trigger Settings*.

. Click *Edit* next to _a CT CPG trigger_ you want to configure.
+
TIP: If you updated the CT CPG package, some triggers will not be added to the *Trigger
Settings* list. xref:admin-guide/triggers-management/manage-ct-cpg-triggers.adoc[Add a record] with the specific CT CPG trigger name.
. In the *Bypass Logic* field, specify the trigger contexts or methods that should not be invoked. For example: [.apiobject]#ai,bd# (where [.apiobject]#ai# stands for [.apiobject]#after insert# and [.apiobject]#bd# stands for [.apiobject]#before delete#)
or [.apiobject]#au_createRD# (where [.apiobject]#au# stands for [.apiobject]#after update# and [.apiobject]#createRD# stands for [.apiobject]#createRelatedData#).
+
TIP: In order to disable the logic of creating [.object]#Activity# objects' records (either for standard or custom [.object]#Activity# objects), for *ActivityProcess* trigger specify [.apiobject]#createRelatedActivities# in the *Bypass logic* field.
. Select the *Active* checkbox.
. Click *Save*.
