The selected records are targeted. For selected _Account_ and _Contact_
records, the _Target Frequency_ records will be created.

* The corresponding _Marketing Detail Tracking_ record will be related
to the _Target Frequency_ record.
For example, the _Account_ record with the *division category D* will be
linked to xref:admin-guide/configuring-targeting-and-marketing-cycles/create-a-new-record-of-marketing-detail-tracking[the
created Marketing Detail Tracking record] with
xref:admin-guide/configuring-targeting-and-marketing-cycles/specify-categories-for-marketing-detail-tracking[the assigned
division category D].
* The _Marketing Detail Tracking_ record with the _Call Rate_ record
type is segmented with the _Account/Contact_ reference to the client.
