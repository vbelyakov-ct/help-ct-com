= Configure a New Record of Division Target Frequency Settings

For proper use of corresponding _Target Frequency_ records, it is required to create a record of the *Division Target Frequency Settings* for the division specified for the _Account_ and _Contact_
records.

NOTE: To use these settings, the same division should be added to the xref:admin-guide/application-settings-management/user-field-reference.adoc[User] and xref:./ref-guide/marketing-cycle-field-reference.adoc[Marketing Cycle] records.

To add a new record of *Division Target Frequency Settings*:

. Go to *Setup → Custom Code → Custom Settings* →
click *Manage* next to *Division Target Frequency Settings*.
. On the next page, click *New* to create a new record:
* In the *Name* section, specify the related division name, for example, _Gamma_, _Delta_, etc.
* In the *Account Target Category field*, add the API Name field of xref:admin-guide/application-settings-management/account-field-reference.adoc[the _Account_ record], that responsible for the new division, for example, `Division_Gamma_Category__c`;
* In the *Account Target Flag field*, add the API Name field of the _Account_ record, that responsible for the selection of the new division, for example, `Division_Gamma_Target_Check__c`;
* Specify the same division fields of xref:admin-guide/application-settings-management/contact-field-reference.adoc[the _Contact_ record] in the *Contact Target Category field* and *Contact Target Flag field*.
* Set a flag next to *Enable Category Selection* if you want to add the
division's categories to xref:image$588320221.png[available values of mass targeting], accounts, and contacts.
