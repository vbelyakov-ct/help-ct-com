or services within a number of scheduled activities:

segmentation using _Account_ and _Contact_ divisions. link:add-a-new-division[Create
a new division] and
link:division-a-new-record-of-division-target-frequency-settings[add
the division to the corresponding custom setting].

works with different KPIs, and division categories could be used to
define specific groups of customers, for example, hypermarkets and
discounters.
