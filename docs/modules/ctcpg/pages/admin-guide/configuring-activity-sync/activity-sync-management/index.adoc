== The Default Activity Sync records

Activity Sync is used to:

* Automatically synchronize the standard _Event/Task_ and _CT CPG Activity_ records. A corresponding record based on the standard _Event/Task_ or _CT CPG Activity_ record will be created.
+
If you have a few _Activity Sync_ records, make sure that active settings do not affect each other to avoid failures during the _Activity Sync_ processes.
* Synchronize changes in records.
* Map fields to update them with the values from the parent _Event/Task_ or _CT CPG Activity_ record via the _Activity Sync_ process.

Three preconfigured inactive records may be edited.
