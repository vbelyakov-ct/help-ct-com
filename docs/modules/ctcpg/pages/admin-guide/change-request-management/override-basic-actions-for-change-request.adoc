= Override Basic Actions for Change Request

By default, when a user opens any _Change Request_ record, the standard  page will be displayed. Instead of having a standard Salesforce page, override the behavior of the *New*, *Edit*, and *View* buttons to open the preconfigured Change Request Visualforce page.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, the _Change Request_ pages are displayed only in the Salesforce Classic interface, regardless of the selected Salesforce mode. The Lightning Experience interface will be introduced later.

This configuration is not necessary due to using the same Change Request page as Standard Layout.

To override basic actions:

. Go to *Setup → Object Manager → Change Request → Buttons, Links, and Actions*.
. Click *Edit* next to the *Edit* label.
. In the *Override Properties* section, select *Visualforce page* and *Change Request[CTCPG__ChangeRequest]* next to *Salesforce Classic Override*.

. Click *Save*.
. Repeat steps 2–4 to the *New* and *View* buttons.

The setup is complete. Now, when you click one of the buttons above, the _Change Request Visualforce_ page will be open.
