. Go to *Setup → Security → Remote Site Settings.*
. Click **New Remote Site **and add the first entry.
* In the *Remote Site Name* field, enter any name you like.
* In the *Remote Site URL* field, enter `https://INSTANCE_NAME.salesforce.com`.

TIP: To obtain ``INSTANCE_NAM``E, go to *Setup → Company Settings* → *Company Information* → find the *Instance* field.
. Click *Save*.

The remote sites are added.
