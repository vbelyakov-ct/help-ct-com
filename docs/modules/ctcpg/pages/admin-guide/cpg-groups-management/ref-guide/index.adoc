=== Group Types

The limit is equal to 500 thousand records per group. If there are more
records, a warning is displayed.

[[h3__1554410513]]
==== Static Group

A static group is a snapshot of records per specific time. It can be
used to send ad hoc emails such as:

* announcements;
* invitations to the events;
* special offers of products;
* etc.

[[h3__1007999912]]
==== Dynamic Group

Use dynamic groups to keep the lists of record per different objects up
to date, e.g.:

* to create a group of users for the onboarding process;
* to create a group of clients who meet specific criteria, for example,
were not visited during the last 2 weeks but have orders for more than $
100 000;
* to derive the list of the most popular products based on product sales
or numeric distribution;
* etc.

=== SOQL Builder to Filter CPG Group Records

SOQL Builder is used for creating a SOQL query to filter records in a
CPG group.

. On a high level, set up a query based on the parent object.
. Add up to a maximum of two subqueries applied to children's records if
needed.



The SOQL builder buttons:

* Click image:62558834.png[] to
add criteria based on the fields of the object's record;
* Click image:62558835.png[] to
add criteria in the brackets;
* Click image:62558838.png[] to
add criteria based on the fields of the child object record;
* Click image:62558844.png[]
to launch validation of the query;
