representatives or for customers during the visit.



The _Quiz_ record has the following record types:

* _Internal quizzes_ are designed:
** to examine representatives' knowledge about CT Products, which are
targeted at customers;
** to get feedback about the representative's daily routine, for
example, how they conduct a meeting, what they like or do not like, how
much time they spend on visits, etc. 
* _External quizzes_ may be used to get feedback from the clients the
representative visited. The passed questionnaire will be linked to the
corresponding _CT CPG Activity_ record, and the received information
will be used for better customer segmentation and understanding of their
needs.

It is possible to create complex quizzes with questions depend on the
previous question or answer.

=== Quiz Model

Each _Quiz_ record has a number of related _Quiz Question_ records. The
passed _Quiz_ is stored as the _Quiz Completion_ record with the
linked _Quiz Answer_ records. The corresponding Quiz Answer record is
related to the _Quiz Partaker_ record and a _CT CPG Activity_ record if
applied. The administrator assigns representatives as the _Quiz
Partakers_ by creating a _Quiz Partaker_ record related to
the _User_ record.
