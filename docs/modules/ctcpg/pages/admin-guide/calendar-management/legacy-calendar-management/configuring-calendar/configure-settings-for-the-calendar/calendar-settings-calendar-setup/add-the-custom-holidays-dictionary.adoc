= Add the Custom Holidays Dictionary

If your company has corporate holidays, add the custom Holidays
dictionary to mark those days as holidays at the calendar grid. Calendar
Settings will affect the custom holidays, for example, if the creation
of a _CT CPG Activity_ record on a weekend is enabled, the
representative can create a _CT CPG Activity_ record on custom holidays.
