Currently, users without Customize Application permission can read
unprotected custom metadata types using different APIs that are provided
by Salesforce. Following the “secure by default” approach, read access
for users without Customize Application permission will be revoked with
this update.

You can allow direct read access to Custom Settings and Custom Metadata
Type by editing:

* Profile settings
* Permission Set settings

For the first option, you will need to configure each profile
separately, or you can edit a permission set and assign it to all users
you want to grant read access to.
