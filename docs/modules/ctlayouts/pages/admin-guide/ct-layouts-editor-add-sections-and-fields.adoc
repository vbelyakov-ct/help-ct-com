* The layout grid height may be enlarged.



Sections obey the following rules:

* To add a section, click the

to one of the available section types.
* When added, the section has a minimum size of 2 units wide and 1 unit
high.
* Sections are added one after the other, starting from the leftmost top
corner of the grid.
* Sections cannot overlap each other.
