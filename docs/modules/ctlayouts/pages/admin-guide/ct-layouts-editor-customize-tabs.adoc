=== Tab and Path Modes

The record screen may be presented in the *Tab* or *Path* mode.

[[h3_683376448]]
==== Tab Mode

The *Tab* mode is suitable for a more advanced presentation of
information separated and distributed to individual tabs.

* The mobile user navigates through the tabs on the record screen in any
order to review data and fill in the required information.
* The administrator cannot customize the color and icon of the tab
header, set statuses for each tab, or use global tab actions.

[[h3_127289700]]
==== Path Mode

The *Path* mode is suitable for running scenarios.

* The mobile user sequentially navigates through tabs on the record
screen and works with the presented records.
* The administrator can set the color and icon of the tab header, add
buttons with a set of actions, and set statuses that will change during
the scenario.
* The administrator can allow users to switch between tabs outside the
specified sequence. So, the user can navigate among tabs and return to
the current one in the scenario by tapping the *Return* button without
changing the visited tab status.
