== Tab and Path Modes

The record screen may be presented in the *Tab* or *Path* mode.

[[h3_683376448]]
=== Tab Mode

The *Tab* mode is suitable for a more advanced presentation of information separated and distributed to individual tabs.

* The mobile user navigates through the tabs on the record screen in any order to review data and fill in the required information.
* The administrator cannot customize the color and icon of the tab header, set statuses for each tab, or use global tab actions.

[[h3_127289700]]
=== Path Mode

The *Path* mode is suitable for running scenarios.

* The mobile user sequentially navigates through tabs on the record screen and works with the presented records.
* The administrator can set the color and icon of the tab header, add buttons with a set of actions, and set statuses that will change during the scenario.
* The administrator can allow users to switch between tabs outside the specified sequence. So, the user can navigate among tabs and return to the current one in the scenario by tapping the *Return* button without changing the visited tab status.

a|Click the *Settings* button and select the *Path* type. Every tab in the *Path* mode should have its own status.

* In the *Status* field, select the field of the *Object* specified in the current _Layout Settings_ record that is responsible for the status, for example, [.apiobject]#CTPHARMA\__Type__c#, [.apiobject]#Status__c#.
* Allocate the values of the selected picklist to the following status groups:
** *New*
+
TIP: By default, all values are added to this field.
** *In Progress*
** *Completed*
+
NOTE: The statuses of neighboring tabs can be placed only in the following sequence: *New → In Progress* (several tabs with this status may be specified) *→ Completed*.
* Under the corresponding status, specify user permission on the tab with this status:
** *readOnly* — all tabs are read-only
** *currentTab* — only the current tab can be edited
** *currentStatus* — only tabs with the current status can be edited
** *groupStatuses* — only tabs in the same group can be edited
** *allStatuses* — only tabs in the same status group can be edited

** Allow the ability *to change the displayed tab*.
+
NOTE: The current tab is the tab that is opened by default or the last tab opened using the navigation buttons. The current tab is not changed if it was opened by tapping on the tab name. So, _the displayed and the current tab may differ_.
** Activate the *Allow close the steps in Progress* checkbox to allow mobile users to close the modal window when the step still has *In Progress* status.
