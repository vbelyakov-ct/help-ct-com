CT Vision IR is a comprehensive solution to recognize images while
working in the CT Mobile app for iOS users. CT Vision IR includes the
server application responsible for routing, storing, and processing
photos, enriching recognition results supplied by the connected image
recognition providers. CT Vision IR allows working with several IR
providers with no additional settings on the CT Mobile sideâ€”switching
between the providers is carried out unnoticeably.

CT Vision IR supports integration with EasyPicky and allows launching
applications on the Activity records, process, and store results in the
CT Mobile app local database.
