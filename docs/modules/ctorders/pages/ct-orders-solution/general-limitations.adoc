= General Limitations

Refer to this article to learn about functional limitations and some of
the known issues of the CT Orders package.

:toc: :toclevels: 3

[[h2_951662406]]
=== General

[[h3_1483371260]]
==== Lightning Web Security

Lightning Web Security for Lightning web components is not
supported. Check the following:

. Go to *Setup → Security → Session Settings*.
. In the *Lightning Web Security* section, check that the *Use Lightning
Web Security for Lightning web components* checkbox is inactive.

The setup is complete.

[[h3_1728072365]]
==== Custom Field Limitations

To avoid errors, the API name of the custom field must be different from
the API name of the CT Orders package field (not including the
[.apiobject]#orders__# namespace prefix) on the same object.
For example, if you have
[.apiobject]#orders__UnitPrice__c# on the Product
object, do not create[.apiobject]#UnitPrice__c#. For more
details, please refer to
the https://trailblazer.salesforce.com/issues_view?id=a1p30000000sY2FAAU[Salesforce
Known Issue].

[[h3_1554838289]]
==== Case Sensitive Settings

CT Orders settings are case-sensitive, so be careful when entering API
names when creating records.

[[h3_1717089794]]
==== Text Area (Rich) Field Limitations

Currently, the CT Mobile app does not fully process the *Text Area
(Rich)* data type. If you enter formatted text or special symbols (as
apostrophes) via the web interface, you will see the text with HTML tags
on the mobile device. We recommend using other *Text* data types or
entering text without formatting.

[[h3_35438396]]
==== Address Configuration

CT Orders does not support the processing of
https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.224.0.api.meta/api/compound_fields_address.htm?search_text=address[compound
fields] (formulas), such as[.apiobject]#BillingAddress# and
[.apiobject]#ShippingAddress#.

[[h2_872355444]]
=== Promotion and Catalog Management

By default, there are no layouts for [.object]#Catalog Line
Item# and [.object]#Promotion Line Item# objects, so when you
add products on the *Product Management* tab, you will see the records'
Ids instead of product names.
xref:admin-guide/workshops/workshop1-0-creating-basic-order/configuring-layout-settings-1-0/index.adoc[Create a layout] to display
the product names.

[[h2_25586823]]
=== Freebies Management

[[h3_25586823]]
==== SOQL Specifications

For freebies with the
xref:admin-guide/workshops/workshop-3-0-working-with-freebies/workshop-3-1-configuring-prioritized-freebie-type/adding-a-freebie-condition-with-the-criteria-based-method-3-1.adoc[Criteria
Based] condition type, the system applies a SOQL filter to search
through the list of records. If [.apiobject]#IN# operator is
required, we suggest selecting
the xref:adding-a-freebie-condition-with-the-list-based-method-3-2[List
Based] freebie condition with the specified list of products instead of
the *Criteria Based* one.

[[h3_1598835347]]
==== Formula Fields

Formula fields requiring recalculation during order management are not
supported for freebies.

[[h3_884774678]]

You cannot create multiple deliveries for the same date and address
combination:

[[h2_1062646429]]
=== Order Management

[[h3_1206446755]]
==== Multiplicator

*Units Count Step* is xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/order-management/multiplicator.adoc[a>multiplicity step]
in the order cart, which must be _divisible_ by the *Units in Package*
value and also _greater than_ that value. I.e. if you set *Units in
Package* to 5, the *Units Count Step* must be at least 10.

[[h2_176614697]]
=== Calculating Discounts

[[h3_1475579741]]
==== Negative values

The built-in calculator and Web Service are not designed to work with
negative values. The calculations are performed modulo and if the
price value is negative, for example, due to very large values of
applied discounts, then there may be errors in further calculations.



This limitation affects all platforms—Salesforce, iOS, and Windows.

[[h3_1001740197]]
==== Formula Fields

Formula fields requiring recalculation during order management are not
supported for calculating discounts.
