=== Architecture

The CT Orders package is designed to seamlessly fit into your
organization's workflow, offering three various approaches to the
implementation of the CT Orders:

. *CRM: CT Pharma / CT CPG {plus} CT Mobile*.
. *ERP {plus} CRM as front end: SAP {plus} CT Pharma / CT CPG {plus} CT
Mobile*.
In this case, promotions must be received from SAP.
. *Combination of ERP and CRM: SAP {plus} CT Pharma / CT CPG {plus} CT
Mobile*.
In this case, you can set parameters in both ERP and CRM. For example,
ERP stores long-term discounts per segment according to the client and
brand. On the CRM side, brand managers can provide short-term promotions
given the marketing strategy for a new product.
