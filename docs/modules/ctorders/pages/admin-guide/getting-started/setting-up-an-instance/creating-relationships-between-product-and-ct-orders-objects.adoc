= Creating Relationships between Product and CT Orders Objects

NOTE: By
default, these relationships are already configured after installing the CT Order package.

To have the ability to add a product from an available catalog or promotion to order and delivery, it is necessary to set up a lookup to the [.object]#CT Product# object on the [.object]#Catalog Line Item#, [.object]#Promotion Line Item#, [.object]#Price Book Line Item#, [.object]#Order Line Item#, [.object]#Freebie Line Item#, and [.object]#Delivery Line Item# objects.

To create a lookup to *CT Product*:

. Go to *Setup → Object Manager → Catalog Line Item → Fields and Relationships* and click *New*.
. Select the *Lookup Relationship* data type for the new custom field and click *Next*.
. Select the *CT Product* (or *Product*, if the CPG package is not installed) object from the *Related to* picklist and click *Next*.
. In the *Field Information* section:
* Enter _Product_ as the *Field Label*.
* Enter _ProductId_ as the *Field Name*.
+
WARNING: The lookup field name must be the same for all objects ([.object]#Catalog Line Item#, [.object]#Promotion Line Item#, [.object]#Price Book Line Item#, [.object]#Order Line Item#, [.object]#Freebie Line Item#, and [.object]#Delivery Line Item#) to avoid an error.
+
[NOTE]
====
When naming the lookup field, please consider the following rules applied by the package logic during a search:

. Search for a field with the [.apiobject]#ProductId__c# name that has lookups to the corresponding object. If the search is unsuccessful, the system proceeds to the next step.
. Search for a field with the [.apiobject]#Product__c# name that has lookups on the corresponding object. If the search is unsuccessful, the system proceeds to the next step.
. Search for lookups that are linked to the corresponding object and select the first one in the search result.
====
* Enter a *Child Relationship Name* for integration purposes: _CatalogLineItems_.

. Select the profiles to which you want to grant edit access to this field via field-level security and click *Next*.
. Make sure the *Catalog Line Item* page layout is selected, if you want the *CT Product* field to be displayed, and click *Next*.
. Specify the *Related List Label* and select the layout that should display the related list field.
. Click *Save*.

The lookup to the [.object]#CT Product# object on the [.object]#Catalog Line Item# is created. Repeat the steps to create a lookup to the [.object]#CT Product# (or [.object]#Product#) object on [.object]#Promotion Line Item#, [.object]#CT Price Book Line Item#, [.object]#Order Line Item#, [.object]#Freebie Line Item#, and [.object]#Delivery Line Item# objects.
