== Allow the same Calculation Types in the Pricing Procedure steps

This custom permission allows you to use the same xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/calculation-types.adoc[Calculation Type] in multiple steps of one xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/price-management/ref-guide/pricing-procedure-v-2/pricing-procedure-v-2-steps/index.adoc[pricing procedure].

NOTE: The xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/discount-data-model/calculated-discount-field-reference.adoc[Calculation Discount] record will store the discount based on the last step of the pricing procedure. It is recommended to use xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/price-management/ref-guide/pricing-procedure-v-2/pricing-procedure-v-2-steps/step-conditions.adoc[conditions for pricing procedure steps] when assigning this permission to avoid double triggering the same Calculation Type.
