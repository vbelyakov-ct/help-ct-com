= CG Cloud: Configuring Addresses

There are several options to configure addresses for retail stores,
which allows you to flexibly set up the CG Cloud integration with CT
Orders.



To set up addresses:

. Define the standard or custom object to use as the
[.object]#Address# object. It is possible to use the
[.object]#Retail Store#,[.object]#Account#, or custom
[.object]#Address# object as the[.object]#Address#
object.
. Create an _OM Settings_ record with the _Object Setting_ record type
and specify the API name of the[.object]#Address# object.
Follow the steps in the
xref:linking-address-to-the-account-object-1-0#h2_1782833325[Specify
the Address Object] guide.
. Create an _OM Settings_ record with the _Address Setting_ record type
and specify the corresponding _Address_ field:
* Using the[.object]#Account# or[.object]#Retail
Store# object, follow the steps in the
xref:linking-address-to-the-account-object-1-0#h2__405395202[Specify
the Address Field] guide.
* Using the custom[.object]#Address# object, follow the steps
in the xref:setting-up-a-custom-address-object-1-0[Set Up a Custom
Address Object] guide.
. Make sure that there is a lookup from the[.object]#Delivery#
object to the corresponding[.object]#Address# object.
. Make sure that there is a lookup from the[.object]#Address#
object to the corresponding[.object]#Account# object.



For your convenience, there is a table with all available combinations
to set up addresses.

create a custom field with the *Text* data type, for example,

* If the[.apiobject]#Retail Store# object is used to specify
the address for the[.apiobject]#Account# object, create a
custom field with the *Text* data type on the[.object]#Retail
Store# object, for example,
[.apiobject]#RetailStoreAddress__c#.

. ​If necessary, xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/address-setting-field-reference[specify the
SOQL query] to sort delivery addresses given the selected
[.object]#Account# or[.object]#Retail Store# object.
For example:

Or the SOQL filter will be written as:

The result will be the ID list of the custom[.object]#Address#
records and values specified in the appropriate field of this object,
for example,[.apiobject]#Address__с#.
