= CG Cloud: Configuring Addresses

There are several options to configure addresses for retail stores,  which allows you to flexibly set up the CG Cloud integration with CT Orders.

To set up addresses:

. Define the standard or custom object to use as the [.object]#Address# object. It is possible to use the [.object]#Retail Store#, [.object]#Account#, or custom [.object]#Address# object as the [.object]#Address# object.
. Create an _OM Settings_ record with the _Object Setting_ record type and specify the API name of the [.object]#Address# object. Follow the steps in the xref:admin-guide/workshops/workshop-1-0-creating-basic-order/configuring-an-address-settings-1-0/linking-address-to-the-account-object-1-0.adoc#h2_1782833325[Specify the Address Object] guide.
. Create an _OM Settings_ record with the _Address Setting_ record type and specify the corresponding _Address_ field:
* Using the [.object]#Account# or [.object]#Retail Store# object, follow the steps in the xref:admin-guide/workshops/workshop-1-0-creating-basic-order/configuring-an-address-settings-1-0/linking-address-to-the-account-object-1-0.adoc#h2_405395202[Specify the Address Field] guide.
* Using the custom [.object]#Address# object, follow the steps in the xref:admin-guide/workshops/workshop-1-0-creating-basic-order/configuring-an-address-settings-1-0/setting-up-a-custom-address-object-1-0.adoc[Set Up a Custom Address Object] guide.
. Make sure that there is a lookup from the [.object]#Delivery# object to the corresponding [.object]#Address# object.
. Make sure that there is a lookup from the [.object]#Address# object to the corresponding [.object]#Account# object.

For your convenience, there is a table with all available combinations to set up addresses.

* If an address is specified on the [.object]#Account# object, create a custom field with the *Text* data type, for example, [.apiobject]#ShippingAddress__c#.

* If the [.apiobject]#Retail Store# object is used to specify the address for the [.apiobject]#Account# object, create a custom field with the *Text* data type on the [.object]#Retail Store# object, for example, [.apiobject]#RetailStoreAddress__c#.

. Create a custom lookup to the corresponding object:
* Lookup(Account)
* Lookup(Retail Store)
. If necessary, xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/address-setting-field-reference.adoc[specify the SOQL query] to sort delivery addresses given the selected [.object]#Account# or [.object]#Retail Store# object.
For example:
+
[source, apex]
----
WHERE ParentId = '{!RetailStore.Id}'
----
+
Or the SOQL filter will be written as:
+
[source, apex]
----
SELECT id FROM RetailStore WHERE (id = '{!RetailStore.Id}') OR (ParentId = '{!Account.Id}')
----
+
The result will be the ID list of the custom [.object]#Address# records and values specified in the appropriate field of this object, for example, [.apiobject]#Address__—Å#.
