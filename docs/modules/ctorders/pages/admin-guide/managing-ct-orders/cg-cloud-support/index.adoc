= CG Cloud Support

To obtain access to the CG Cloud objects, create a case to Salesforce.

https://www.salesforce.com/eu/products/consumer-goods-cloud/overview/[CG
Cloud] is the standard Salesforce solution for CPG companies to keep
essential products in the right stores. Integrate CG Cloud with our CT
Orders package to gain advantages from both products.

=== Object Model

The CT Orders object model with CG Cloud support allows you to apply the
CT Orders logic to the [.object]#Salesforce Product# and
[.object]#Retail Store# objects. Depending on your business
goals, you can either set up support for the Salesforce products or both
Salesforce products and retail stores.

When the CT CPG or CT Pharma package is installed in your Salesforce
instance, if necessary, set up dynamic groups with Salesforce products
or retail stores and/or the appropriate[.object]#Product
Component# object for bundles.

CT Orders can work without the CT CPG or CT Pharma solution if the Sales
Cloud, E-Commerce, or CG Cloud license is activated.

==== Salesforce Product

To work with the [.object]#Salesforce Product# object:

. xref:cg-cloud-configuring-object-setting[Create an OM Settings
record] of the Object Setting record type and specify the
[.object]#Salesforce Product# object.
. When configuring the settings, use the
[.apiobject]#orders__Product2Id__c# lookups on the
following objects:
*[.object]#Order Line Item#
*[.object]##[.object]#Delivery Line Item#
*[.object]##[.object]#Catalog Line Item#
*[.object]##[.object]#Promotion Line Item#
*[.object]##[.object]#CT Price Book Line Item#
*[.object]##[.object]#Freebie Line Item#
. â€‹To work with bundles, in *Object Settings* select the
[.object]#Product Component# object of the target system, such
as CT CPG or CT Pharma. If the [.object]#Product Component# is
left blank, but the *Bundle* checkbox is active for
a [.object]#Salesforce Product# record, this record will be
considered a regular product.

[[h3_2058563056]]
==== Retail Store

Working with retail stores is the same as working with the accounts, for
example, you can assign retail stores to catalog(s) and promotion(s),
create a dynamic group with retail stores and/or Salesforce products,
create orders, and set up deliveries to the retail store addresses.

Please note, that the [.object]#Retail Store# object records
(child) are always linked to the [.object]#Account# object
(parent) by the Master-Detail relationship.
The [.object]#Account# object stores information about retail
business accounts, including billing and shipping payment information
and store hierarchies. The [.object]#Retail Store# object stores
the information about each physical store. Considering this relationship
for the CT Orders, if you want to create an order from
the [.object]#Retail Store# object, the *Order Allowed* checkbox
should be active on the parent [.object]#Account# object.



To work with the standard[.object]#Retail Store# object:

. Create a xref:cg-cloud-creating-a-sales-organization[Sales
Organization] record and specify the [.object]#Retail Store#
object for it.
. Add the [.apiobject]#RetailStoreId__c# lookup to the
[.object]#Catalog# and *Promotion* objects.
. Assign the desired[.object]#Promotions# and
[.object]#Catalogs# to the [.object]#Retail Store#
records. If necessary,
xref:setting-up-a-dynamic-group-assignment-1-0[create a dynamic
group] with proper retail stores to assign to catalogs and promotions.
. xref:cg-cloud-configuring-addresses[Configure addresses].

=== CG Cloud Support in the CT Mobile iOS app

To work with CG Cloud in the CT Mobile app, the standard Visit record
screen must be configured with the help
of https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-layouts-en/creating-a-layout-settings-record[the
CT Layouts solution]. Mobile users can work with both CG Cloud and CT
Orders solutions in the CT Mobile app for iOS users.

. Set up xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/cg-cloud-support/cg-cloud-support#h3_656771318[Salesforce Product] and
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/cg-cloud-support/cg-cloud-support#h3_2058563056[Retail Stores].
. To create an order, use
https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/managing-visits-to-retail-stores/a/h3_190353401[the
Place Order assessment task].

=== Dynamic Groups Assignment

In the case of
xref:cg-cloud-setting-up-dynamic-group-assignment[using dynamic
groups], set up the support of the [.object]#Retail Store#
object with the help of the SDK of the target system, such as CT CPG or
CT Pharma.

It is necessary to create custom Apex classes and trigger to implement
this logic.
