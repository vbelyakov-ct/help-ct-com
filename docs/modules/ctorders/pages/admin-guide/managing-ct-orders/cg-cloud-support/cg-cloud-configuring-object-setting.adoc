= CG Cloud: Configuring Object Setting

According to the _Settings_ record with the _Object Settings_ record
type, CT Orders supports different implementations based on the objects
in use:

* Only[.object]#Salesforce Products#;
*[.object]#Salesforce Products# and[.object]#Retail
Stores#;

* When the CT CPG or CT Pharma package is installed in your Salesforce
instance:
** the appropriate[.object]#Product Component# object to create
bundles;
** support of the[.object]#Salesforce Product# or
[.object]#Retail Store# objects in dynamic groups.



To create the _Settings_ record with the _Object Settings_ record type
when the CT CPG or CT Pharma package is installed in your Salesforce
instance:

. Go to the *Settings* tab and click *New*.
. In the *New Settings* window, select *Object Settings* record type.
. Specify the following:
* *Activity Object*: select the desired[.object]#Activity#
object (_CPG_ or _Pharma,_ depending on the installed target system).
* *Product Object*:** **select *Salesforce Product*.
* Select the corresponding *Product Component Object*, which will be
used as the bundle component.
* In case of using dynamic groups, specify *Group Object* and *Group
Member Object*. For more information, refer
to xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/cg-cloud-support/cg-cloud-setting-up-dynamic-group-assignment[CG Cloud: Set
up a Dynamic Group Assignment].
* *Address Object*:** **specify the API name of the desired
[.object]#Address# object. It is possible to use
the [.object]#Account#, [.object]#Retail Store#, or
custom [.object]#Address# object.
* *SKU Field*: specify the API name of the standard *Active* field of
the[.object]#Salesforce Product #object.

Field* setting is required for the proper operation of
the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/catalog-management/catalog-management[Catalog] and xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/promotions[Promotions] pages.
The *SKU* attribute defines whether the product record can be added to
an order. It distinguishes the product SKU record from other product
records used to create hierarchy, such as brands, families, etc. You may
create a custom field of the [.object]#Product# object to use as
the *SKU Field*.
