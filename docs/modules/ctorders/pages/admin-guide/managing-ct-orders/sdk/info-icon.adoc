= Info Icon

Available for Salesforce users only.

Use SDK to add a dedicated icon with additional information to the order
layout to display with the embedded HTML or open a new window with its
own URL. Though the information displayed in the info icon can contain
any kind of interactive data, it cannot be used in calculation
processes.



To set up a new custom info icon,
xref:5-6-sdk-displaying-info-icon[create an OM Settings record]
with the *SDK Setting* record type. For more information, refer
to xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/sdk-setting-field-reference[SDK Setting Field Reference].

* The *SDK Type* field determines the display position of the icon and
the display of a different HTML, while the *Icon* field is a specified
icon that can be picked from
https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/icons/#utility[the Utility Icons
set] of the Salesforce Lightning Design System.
* Specify one of the following in the SDK Type field to display icon in
the desired place on the order layout:

If there are no records, for example, a catalog without products, the
Info icon will be displayed next to it anyway.
