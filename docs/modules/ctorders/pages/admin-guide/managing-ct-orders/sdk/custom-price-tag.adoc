= Custom Price Tag

Available for Salesforce users only.

With the help of SDK, implement the custom price tags instead of the
default ones available out of the box.

Custom price tags allow you:

* To supplement the currently used price tags.
* To implement the current calculation logic but altering the displayed
results.
* To completely rewrite the price tags to display any kind of
information embedded in an HTML format.
