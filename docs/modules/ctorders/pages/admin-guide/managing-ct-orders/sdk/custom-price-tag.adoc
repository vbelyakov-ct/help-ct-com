= Custom Price Tag

NOTE: Available for Salesforce users only.

With the help of SDK, implement the custom price tags instead of the default ones available out of the box.

Custom price tags allow you:

* To supplement the currently used price tags.
* To implement the current calculation logic but altering the displayed results.
* To completely rewrite the price tags to display any kind of information embedded in an HTML format.
