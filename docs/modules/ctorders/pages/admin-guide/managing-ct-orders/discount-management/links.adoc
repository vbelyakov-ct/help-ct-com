The *Links* functionality helps managers to conduct advanced discount
calculations by creating condition dependencies based on different or
the same[.object]#Calculation Types#. Links are available both
to regular products and freebies and, in case of several appropriate
records, will be sequentially applied to the order.

=== Overview

Links are based on non-zero conditions and applied after calculating all
freebie conditions and discount conditions according to *Apply Condition
Type* of the appropriate
 xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/calculation-types.adoc-field-reference[Calculation Type] **
records. Available for [.object]#Calculation
Type# of *Condition* record type.



The xref:condition-dependency-field-reference[Condition Dependency]
records define the links between conditions:

[TIP] ==== When creating a record, only the required fields will
be displayed, depending on the selected *Dependency Type*. Also, for
records with errors, a validation will be triggered. ====

* If several conditions are found for one[.object]#Calculation
Type#, then links are applied sequentially according to the *Order*
field of the appropriate *Condition Dependency* records.
* If the condition was canceled on earlier links, it cannot be applied
in further links in the sequence.
* xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/discount-data-model/calculated-discount-field-reference.adoc[Calculation Logs] are
generated after all links have been applied and contain all the
resulting values ​​for all[.object]#Conditions# that have been
applied for each[.object]#Calculation Type#.
* Administrators can set 4 types of condition dependencies and the
sequence of applying them to the orders.

|*Dependency Action* |*Available Dependency Type* |*Description*
|*Example*

|Apply a|
* Discount To Discount
* Discount To Freebie
* Freebie To Freebie
* Freebie To Discount

|The dependent condition will be applied only when the controlling
condition is applied. a|
Given:

Condition 1 is 30% and suitable for the order

Condition 2 is 40% and not suitable for the order

Condition 3 is 10% and suitable for the order

Link 1: Condition 1 depends on Condition 2

Link 2: Condition 3 depends on Condition 1

Sequence: Link 1 and Link 2



Then:

Then Link 1 cannot be applied due to Condition 2 does not fit the order.
The system checks Link 2 and applies both Condition 3 and Condition 1.
The discount is 50%.

|Exclude a|
* Discount To Discount
* Discount To Freebie
* Freebie To Freebie
* Freebie To Discount

|The dependent condition will be applied only when the controlling
condition is not suitable for the order. a|
Given:

Condition 1 is 30% and suitable for the order

Condition 2 is 40% and not suitable for the order

Condition 3 is 10% and suitable for the order

Link 1: Condition 1 depends on Condition 2

Link 2: Condition 3 depends on Condition 1

Sequence: Link 1 and Link 2



Then:

Then Link 1 is applied due to Condition 2 does not fit the order. The
system then checks Link 2 that cannot be applied due to the controlling
condition that is suitable for the order. The discount is 30%.

|Best Of |Discount To Discount a|
The conditions are compared, and the best condition is applied.

* The maximum discount if the *Calculation Method* is *Decrease* on the
appropriate[.object]#Calculation Type#.
* The maximum markup if the *Calculation Method* is *Increase* on the
appropriate[.object]#Calculation Type#.

a|
Given:

List Price is 100$

Condition 1 is 5%

Condition 2 is 8%

Calculation Method is Decrease


Then:

The system compares prices after discount:

Condition 1: 100$ – 5% = 92$

Condition 2: 100$ – 8% = 95%

The Condition 2 is better and will be applied.

|Reduce |Freebie To Freebie a|
The maximum freebie quantity in the dependent condition will reduce by
the freebie quantity that was applied when the controlling condition is
triggered.



The [.object]#Freebie Condition# for the dependent freebie:

* Cannot be proportional (the *Proportional* checkbox must be inactive).
* Cannot have the *Adding Method* = *Similar*.

a|
Given:

Controlling Freebie Condition: 8 freebies.

Dependent Freebie Condition: 24 freebies.



Then:

8 freebies are taken from the controlling condition, and then 24 – 8 =
16 freebies are taken from the dependent condition.

=== Working with Links

Links with different dependency actions may be used for the same order
according to the *Order* field in case to reduce the discount
conditions.

* Links with the *Apply*, *Exclude*, and *Best Of* dependency actions
for regular products are calculated when a sales rep:
** opens the order cart and click the *Calculate Discounts* button;
** opens the *Freebies* window;
** clicks *Save* in the *Freebie* window;
** clicks *Save* in the *Delivery Summary* window.
* Links with the *Apply*, *Exclude*, and *Reduce* dependency actions for
freebies are applied when a sales rep opens a *Freebie* window.
[NOTE] ==== If the freebie condition is set as *Controlling
Freebie Condition* in the[.object]#Condition Dependency ==== ,
then it is applicable only when adding a freebie to the order. #

When a sales rep opens the order cart, they will see a warning about
non-valid prices. To calculate discounts, they should click the
*Calculate Discounts* button.

* The system checks all freebies in the order and finds all matching
conditions from the appropriate *Calculation Type* records for
[.object]#Delivery Line Items#. If there are non-zero conditions
and these conditions are used in the *Links* logic, they will be applied
to the order according to the *Condition Dependency* records in the
sequence based on the *Order* field.

If the sales rep saves changes for freebies in the *Freebies* window,
discounts for both regular products and freebies will be recalculated.
