= Calculation Types

The link:calculation-types-field-reference[Calculation Type] stores
the set of rules for calculating a particular type of discount. The
_Calculation Type_ determines whether a discount should be calculated
separately or in combination with other discount types.



The discount is calculated according to the
link:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/price-management/ref-guide/pricing-procedure-fields-reference[Pricing Procedure], which
is defined by a link:calculation-types-field-reference[Calculation
Type] via the
link:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/price-management/ref-guide/procedure-calculation-type-fields-reference[Procedure
Calculation Type]. The relationship is automatically managed by the
system.

Each _Calculation Type_ has conditions and/or a group of conditions that
the products in the order must meet to apply to them a discount. On the
selected *Calculation Types* tab, select the desired _Calculation Type_
record *(1)* to view all the associated _Procedure Calculation
Types _*(2)*, _Condition Group _*(3)*, and _Condition _*(4)* records.

* _Condition Group_ is present for the _Calculation Type_ record with
the _Group {plus} Condition_ record type.
* Only one _Condition_ from the ** _Calculation Type_ can be applied to
the _Order Line Item_.

Also, it is possible to avoid a discount application under the presence
of certain products in the order cart. For more information, refer
to link:condition-exceptioncondition-c-field-specification[Condition:
ExceptionCondition__c Field Specification].

This field is used to specify the fields by which the quantity for a
_Delivery Line Item_ or _Order Line Item_ will be counted, and when the
required quantity is reached, a discount will be provided.

On the child _Condition_ records of the parent _Condition Group_ record,
the system checks the expected values for the specified *Order Line
Item* fields.

* When the appropriate record is found and the condition is met, a
discount is applied. Otherwise, the system checks the next _Condition_
record according to its *Order* field.
* There may be no matching conditions. In this case, the system goes to
the next _Calculation Type_ record.
[NOTE] ==== Since the CT Orders package Spring '22, if the
matching _Condition_ record was not found, the system checks the next
_Condition Group_ record. ====

|Condition a|
All paths to the *Condition Detail* field on the _Calculation Type_
records with the _Condition_ record type.



This occurs automatically when creating the conditions, but may require
manual editing of the *Condition Field List* if any changes or the
removal of the conditions were made.

Depending on the value, either the first appropriate condition, or only
the first non-zero condition, or all non-zero conditions of the
_Calculation Type_ record will be considered for the discount.

On the _Condition_ ** record, the system checks the JSON with the path
to the *Order Line Item* fields and the expected values used for
checking for matching conditions.

* When the appropriate record is found, a discount is applied.
Otherwise, the system checks the next _Condition_ record according to
its *Order* field.
* There may be no matching conditions. In this case, the system goes to
the next _Calculation Type_ record.
