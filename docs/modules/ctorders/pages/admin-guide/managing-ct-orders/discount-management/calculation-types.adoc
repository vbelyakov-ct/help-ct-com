= Calculation Types

The  xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/discount-data-model/calculation-types-field-reference/index.adoc[Calculation Type] stores the set of rules for calculating a particular type of discount. The _Calculation Type_ determines whether a discount should be calculated separately or in combination with other discount types.

The discount is calculated according to the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/price-management/ref-guide/pricing-procedure-fields-reference.adoc[Pricing Procedure], which is defined by a  xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/discount-data-model/calculation-types-field-reference/index.adoc[Calculation Type] via the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/price-management/ref-guide/procedure-calculation-type-fields-reference.adoc[Procedure Calculation Type]. The relationship is automatically managed by the system.

Each _Calculation Type_ has conditions and/or a group of conditions that the products in the order must meet to apply to them a discount. On the selected *Calculation Types* tab, select the desired _Calculation Type_ record *(1)* to view all the associated _Procedure Calculation Types_ *(2)*, _Condition Group_ *(3)*, and _Condition_ *(4)* records.

* _Condition Group_ is present for the _Calculation Type_ record with the _Group {plus} Condition_ record type.
* Only one _Condition_ from the _Calculation Type_ can be applied to the _Order Line Item_.

Also, it is possible to avoid a discount application under the presence of certain products in the order cart.

On the child _Condition_ records of the parent _Condition Group_ record, the system checks the expected values for the specified *Order Line Item* fields.

* When the appropriate record is found and the condition is met, a discount is applied. Otherwise, the system checks the next _Condition_ record according to its *Order* field.
* There may be no matching conditions. In this case, the system goes to the next _Calculation Type_ record.

NOTE: Since the CT Orders package Spring '22, if the matching _Condition_ record was not found, the system checks the next _Condition Group_ record.

|Condition a|
All paths to the *Condition Detail* field on the _Calculation Type_ records with the _Condition_ record type.

This occurs automatically when creating the conditions, but may require manual editing of the *Condition Field List* if any changes or the removal of the conditions were made.

a|
Depending on the value, either the first appropriate condition, or only the first non-zero condition, or all non-zero conditions of the _Calculation Type_ record will be considered for the discount.

a| On the _Condition_ record, the system checks the JSON with the path to the *Order Line Item* fields and the expected values used for checking for matching conditions.

* When the appropriate record is found, a discount is applied. Otherwise, the system checks the next _Condition_ record according to its *Order* field.
* There may be no matching conditions. In this case, the system goes to the next _Calculation Type_ record.
