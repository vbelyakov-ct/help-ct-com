==== Filtering Options

Search is carried out in the fields that are listed on the product
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=search_results_setup_parent.htm&type=5[Search
Results] search layout (including the *Name* field). If you select
multiple filters, the products will be displayed that match the selected
criteria.

You can search:

* in list views of general products;
* in dynamic groups;
* by External IDs;
* by a product name.
[NOTE] ==== Create the *SKU* checkbox for the target
[.object]#Product ==== object and specify it in the
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/object-setting-field-reference[Object Setting] record for the
Salesforce organization. This property signifies that this product is a
stock-keeping unit that can be added to catalogs.#

[[h3__1395193200]]
==== Promotion Products

To add products to catalogs, it is necessary to create
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/layout-setting-field-reference[a Layout Setting record] for
the [.object]#Promotion Line Item# object. If a *Layout
Setting* for the object is not found or no field is specified, the
record ID will be displayed instead of a product name.

Unlike catalogs, promotions do not support product hierarchy and are
always listed consecutively.

* To add a product, drag and drop selected products to the empty box on
the top of the right section.
* Select *Use For Discount* for[.object]#Promotion Line Items#
that you want to add to the promotion products list.
* Select *Exclude From Discount* for[.object]#Promotion Line
Items# that you want to exclude from the discount calculation for this
certain product.
* Click *Save* so that selected products will be displayed in the
*Discount Management* list.
* Added product is represented as
xref:promotion-line-item-field-reference[the Promotion Line Item
record].
* If the products are not added to the list, try refreshing the page.

[[h2__1068677388]]
=== Discount Management

The *Discount Management* tab on the _Promotion_ record page allows you
to assign discount levels according to rates for the selected
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/promotions#h3__1395193200[promotion products].

* The *Discount Rate* unit of measure is automatically obtained from the
assigned xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/calculation-types[calculation type] for a promotion
(amount or %).
* Discounts for promotions are saved as the
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/discount-data-model/condition-field-reference/index.adoc[Condition] record with linked
xref:condition-level-field-reference[Condition Level] records. You
can also add new levels directly on the related **Calculation
Type **page in the *Condition* section.

=== Freebies Management

Once you have selected products to use for freebies in the
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/promotions#h2_333729072[*Product Management* tab] and set up

[[h2__492952072]]
=== Promotion Assignment

A created promotion can be available for a specific set of accounts or
to all accounts in your instance by applying the *Available for all
accounts* checkbox on the *Details* tab of the Promotion record page. In
the latter case, the *Sales Org* selection field in the promotion
settings will be inactive. Otherwise, you need to assign a promotion to
accounts, which means creating
xref:promotion-assignment-field-reference[a Promotion Assignment
record].



To display the *Promotion Assignment* tab on the layout, you need to
configure xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/layout-setting-field-reference[a Layout Setting
record] for the *Promotion Assignment* object. Drag and drop promotions
to assign them to the selected Account record.

If you selected multiple filters, accounts will be displayed that match
all the selected criteria.

CT Orders allows filtering promotions available for a selected account
dynamically.



To apply dynamic search logic:

. Define the [.object]#Group# and[.object]#Group
Member# objects of the target package in the
xref:admin-guide/getting-started/setting-up-an-instance/configuring-object-setting[Object Settings].
. Create a lookup to the [.object]#Group# object of the CT
package on the [.object]#Promotion# object.
. Make sure the promotion is not available for all accounts (checkbox is
not selected).
. Create a dynamic group.
* https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-cpg-publication/create-and-update-a-dynamic-cpg-group[Create
and Update a Dynamic CPG Group]
* https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-pharma-publication/create-and-update-a-dynamic-pharma-group[Create

. Assign a dynamic group, create a new _Settings_ record with the
_Object Setting_ record type, and specify the referenced objects in
*Group Object* and *Group Member Object* fields.
