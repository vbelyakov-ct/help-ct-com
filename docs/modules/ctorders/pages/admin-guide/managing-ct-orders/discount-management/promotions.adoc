= Promotions
:toc:

Promotion is a particular type of discount that uses specific syntax and is effectively managed via the user-friendly web interface while allowing to cover difficult discount calculation scenarios.

The *Promotion* page is implemented as a Lightning component with four tabs:

* The <<h2_1422482942, Details>> tab with the main promotion info, such as status, promotion availability, order dates, and delivery dates.
* The <<Product Management>> tab consists of two sections. The left list section displays a list or hierarchy view of products available for adding to xref:./promotion-data-model/promotion-field-reference.adoc[a promotion]. The right list section displays products added to a promotion, which are represented as the xref:./promotion-data-model/promotion-line-item-field-reference.adoc[Promotion Line Item] records.
* The <<Discount Management>> tab is used for the discount level assignment for the selected promotion products.
* The <<Promotion Assignment>> tab consists of two sections. The left list section displays a list of xref:./promotion-data-model/promotion-field-reference.adoc[promotions]. In the right list section, assign promotions for accounts.

== Promotion Settings

On the *Details* tab, you can see and edit the following:

. Specify the promotion status:
* *Draft* is the default status for the newly created promotion. Promotion is not available for users.
* *Active* means that promotion is available for all users.
+
You cannot change settings for active promotion. Set it to draft to introduce changes.
* *Closed* means that the promotion is expired and is no longer active. It will not be displayed for CT Mobile users.
+
Promotion is automatically set as *Closed* when the current date is later than the *Delivery End Date.*
* *Canceled* is set for invalid promotions or promotions canceled by the administrator.
. It is necessary to specify the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/calculation-types.adoc[Calculation Type] for a promotion.
. Specify order and delivery promotion dates.
* *Order Dates* must not be later than *Delivery Dates*.
* If a sales rep changes delivery dates to incorrect dates in xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/order-management/offline-order.adoc[the CT Mobile app], the number of eligible promotional products in the order cart will be reset and blocked.
. Specify the long-term discount dates.

== Product Management

The *Product Management* tab on the _Promotion_ record page allows you to create promotions that include xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/product-management/index.adoc[products and product bundles].

* On the left side, the available promotions are displayed as a list (image:product-mgmt-list-icon.png[25,25]) or according to hierarchy (image:product-mgmt-hierarchy-icon.png[25,25]). Use the toggle to the appropriate view and the image:product-mgmt-filter-icon.png[25,25] button to sort and search.

=== Filtering Options

Search is carried out in the fields that are listed on the product link:https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=search_results_setup_parent.htm&type=5[Search Results] search layout (including the *Name* field). If you select multiple filters, the products will be displayed that match the selected criteria.

You can search:

* in list views of general products;
* in dynamic groups;
* by External IDs;
* by a product name.
+
NOTE: Create the *SKU* checkbox for the target [.object]#Product object and specify it in the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/object-setting-field-reference.adoc[Object Setting] record for the Salesforce organization. This property signifies that this product is a stock-keeping unit that can be added to catalogs.

[[h3_1395193200]]
=== Promotion Products

To add products to catalogs, it is necessary to create xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/layout-setting-field-reference.adoc[a Layout Setting record] for the [.object]#Promotion Line Item# object. If a *Layout
Setting* for the object is not found or no field is specified, the record ID will be displayed instead of a product name.

Unlike catalogs, promotions do not support product hierarchy and are always listed consecutively.

* To add a product, drag and drop selected products to the empty box on the top of the right section.
* Select *Use For Discount* for [.object]#Promotion Line Items# that you want to add to the promotion products list.
* Select *Exclude From Discount* for [.object]#Promotion Line Items# that you want to exclude from the discount calculation for this certain product.
* Click *Save* so that selected products will be displayed in the *Discount Management* list.
* Added product is represented as xref:./promotion-data-model/promotion-line-item-field-reference.adoc[the Promotion Line Item
record].
+
TIP: If the products are not added to the list, try refreshing the page.

== Discount Management

The *Discount Management* tab on the _Promotion_ record page allows you to assign discount levels according to rates for the selected xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/promotions.adoc#h3_1395193200[promotion products].

* The *Discount Rate* unit of measure is automatically obtained from the assigned xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/calculation-types.adoc[calculation type] for a promotion (amount or %).
* Discounts for promotions are saved as the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/discount-data-model/condition-field-reference/index.adoc[Condition] record with linked xref:./discount-data-model/condition-level-field-reference.adoc[Condition Level] records. You
can also add new levels directly on the related *Calculation Type* page in the *Condition* section.

== Freebies Management

Once you have selected products to use for freebies in the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/promotions.adoc#h2_333729072[*Product Management* tab] and set up xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/freebies-management/index.adoc#h3_1307099884[Freebie type], you can configure Freebies in the *Freebies Management* tab. See detailed description here: xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/freebies-management/freebie-management-tab.adoc[Freebies Management Tab].

== Promotion Assignment

A created promotion can be available for a specific set of accounts or to all accounts in your instance by applying the *Available for all accounts* checkbox on the *Details* tab of the Promotion record page. In the latter case, the *Sales Org* selection field in the promotion settings will be inactive. Otherwise, you need to assign a promotion to
accounts, which means creating xref:./promotion-data-model/promotion-assignment-field-reference.adoc[a Promotion Assignment
record].

To display the *Promotion Assignment* tab on the layout, you need to configure xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/layout-setting-field-reference.adoc[a Layout Setting record] for the [.object]#Promotion Assignment# object. Drag and drop promotions to assign them to the selected Account record.

TIP: If you selected multiple filters, accounts will be displayed that match all the selected criteria.

[[h3_1519768260]]
=== Dynamic Promotions Assignment

CT Orders allows filtering promotions available for a selected account dynamically.

To apply dynamic search logic:

. Define the [.object]#Group# and [.object]#Group Member# objects of the target package in the xref:admin-guide/getting-started/setting-up-an-instance/configuring-object-setting.adoc[Object Settings].
. Create a lookup to the [.object]#Group# object of the CT package on the [.object]#Promotion# object.
. Make sure the promotion is not available for all accounts (checkbox is not selected).
. Create a dynamic group.
* xref:ctcpg:admin-guide/cpg-groups-management/create-and-update-a-dynamic-cpg-group.adoc[]
* xref:ctpharma:admin-guide/pharma-groups-management/create-and-update-a-dynamic-pharma-group.adoc[]
. Assign a dynamic group, create a new _Settings_ record with the _Object Setting_ record type, and specify the referenced objects in *Group Object* and *Group Member Object* fields.

[[h2_1374863314]]
