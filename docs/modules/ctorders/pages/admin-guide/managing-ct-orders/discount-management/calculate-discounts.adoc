in CT Mobile to get the valid prices. The invalid prices will be
highlighted in red color.

* When the calculation is done, the *Calculate Discount* button will be
deactivated and a sales rep can *Finalize* the order.
* Also, the discount will be automatically recalculated if the sales rep
has changed fields on xref:delivery-management#h2__1374863314[the
Delivery Summary screen] that may affect the discount or condition and
tapped *Save*.
