|Condition Fields List
|[.apiobject]#orders__ConditionFieldsList__c# |Long Text
Area(32768) |List of fields that are available for the user. The list
includes all child fields for[.object]#Condition Group# and
[.object]#Condition# objects.

The field is automatically updated based on the *Condition Fields Update
Type* value.

|Condition Fields Update Type
|[.apiobject]#orders__ConditionFieldsUpdateType__c#
|Picklist a|
The way of updating the conditions fields list:

* Real-time: the stored list of fields will be updated whenever the
values in the *Condition Details* field on[.object]#Condition#
records are changed.
* Batch update: the stored fields will be updated in batches. Can be
enabled only if the *Force Condition Fields Update* checkbox is
selected.
When a batch is processed, the checkbox is deselected.

|Condition Recalculation Fields
|[.apiobject]#orders__ConditionRecalculationFields__c#
|Long Text Area(32768) a|
Specify the API names of fields that will initiate the matching
conditions search for[.object]#Order Line Item# records from
the beginning when changed.

* Only fields from the [.object]#Order#
[.object]#Delivery# and[.object]#Order Line Item#
objects are supported. If the specified fields belong to any other
object, these fields will be skipped in the process.
* Users must have access to the specified fields. Otherwise, the price
fields will be based on the [.apiobject]#$.listPrice# field.

|Discount Recalculation Fields
|[.apiobject]#orders__DiscountRecalculationFields__c#
|​Long Text Area(32768) a|
Specify the API name of a field in JSON format that, when changed, will
initiate the recalculation of a discount within each condition.

* Only fields from the [.object]#Order#,
[.object]#Delivery#,[.object]#Order Line Item# and
[.object]#Delivery Line Item# objects are supported. If the
specified fields belong to any other object, these fields will be
skipped in the process.

The same recalculation logic is applied when the *Quantity* field is
changed.

[.object]#Order Line Item# or[.object]#Delivery Line
Item#. Available values:

* Order Line Item (default)
* Delivery Line Item

This field applies only to xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/web-service/index.adoc[Web Service]
calculations and does not affect the internal calculator. Pricing
procedures with this field will be ignored and excluded from
the xref:price-tag[Price Tag] logic.

|Force Condition Fields Update
|[.apiobject]#orders__IsForceConditionFieldsUpdate__c#
|Checkbox |If selected, the *Condition Fields List* field will be
updated after the [.object]#Condition# object fields were
changed on the child records.

|[.apiobject]#orders__isNeedConditionFieldsUpdate__c#

purposes.

|Level Based On |[.apiobject]#orders__LevelBasedOn__c#
|Picklist a|
Select the object where the calculation will be performed:

* Order Line Item.
* Delivery Line Item.

If the *Delivery Line Item* is selected, the processing of the
*Condition* records will be the same as for the [.object]#Order
Line Item# object and the conditions will be calculated based on values
on the *Order Line Item* records.



|Level Formula |[.apiobject]# orders__LevelFormula__c#
|​Long Text Area(32768) a|
The formula in JSON format is used to calculate quantity across multiple
fields.



The source object for formula fields is defined in the *Level Based On*
field.



It is possible to use fields with the *Number* and *Currency* types to
calculate quantity or amount, and the values from these fields can be
used for the discount calculation based on the entire order or the
previous deliveries. In this case, an additional step should be
specified in the Pricing Procedure to process this summary.

To see the example, refer to
xref:calculation-type-levelformula-c-field-specification[Calculation
Type: LevelFormula__c Field Specification].
