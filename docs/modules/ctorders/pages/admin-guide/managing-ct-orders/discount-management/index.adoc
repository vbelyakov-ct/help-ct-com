= Discount Management

Discount management provides full control over the discount calculation
procedures, including the creation of different calculation types with
specific conditions according to your organization's marketing approach
and elaborate adjustment of the advanced calculation method for complex
scenarios with promotions.

=== Definition

* *Calculation Type*
The unique entity in the system stores the set of rules for calculating
a particular type of discount. The[.object]#Calculation
Type# determines whether a discount should be calculated separately or
in combination with other discount types.
* *Promotions (Promo)*
A particular _Calculation Type_ that uses specific syntax and can be
configured via the user-friendly web interface. Promotion conditions can
be configured for a group of clients and a group of products, as the
_Discount Rate_ differs per each quantity/amount level. Conditions may
affect different products that have required/min/max attributes.

=== Object Model

Since CT Orders Summer '22 and CT Mobile iOS 2.7, you can
use xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/web-service/index.adoc[the Web Service] to execute calculations from
different channels in one place instead of a built-in calculator.

* If you are using Salesforce record IDs in discount settings, use only
18-character IDs.
* The mobile user must have at least read access to the fields in
the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/price-management/ref-guide/pricing-procedure-fields-reference[Pricing
Procedure] or xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/discount-management#h3__1225315997[recalculation
fields] to calculate _Total Price_. Otherwise, the total price will be
calculated by *List Price* fields.
* Formula fields requiring recalculation during order management are not
supported.

Calculation of discounts for[.object]#Order Line Items# is
performed by the method of consecutive application of rules with
appropriate criteria. The rules are manifested in the
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/discount-data-model/condition-field-reference/index.adoc[Condition] and
xref:condition-group-field-reference[Condition Group] child records
and filtered and applied one by one in a distinct order.

. Create an Order.
*Pricing Procedure* selected in order settings defines _Calculation
Type_ records which will be checked for appropriate criteria and applied
to[.object]#Order Line Items#.
image:calculation-types-2020-05-24-1.png[]
. The system picks the first listed _Calculation Type_ record.
. The records' filtering order is determined by the number in the
*Order* field on each _Condition_ or _Condition Group_ child record.
Search is executed starting from 0 in ascending order. You can set up
the order in which the records will be checked.
. If *Start Date* and *End Date* are specified on the _Condition Group_
or _Condition_ record, they should lie within the date range specified
in order settings.
. For _Condition Group_ records only: fields specified in the *Condition
Fields* are not empty on the _Order Line Items_ and can be accessed by a
current user.
image:calculation-types-2020-05-22-2.png[]
_Example interpretation:_ the first field is located on the _Order Line
Item_ record, then the search mechanism jumps to next objects:
[.apiobject]#orders__OrderLineItem__c# →
[.apiobject]#orders__Order__c# →
[.apiobject]#order__Account__c# → the
[.apiobject]#Personal_Discount__c# custom field.
. *Condition Details* field on the _Condition_ record should contain
expected values for a field specified in the *Condition Fields List*
field.
. The system checks the *Exception Condition* field on each condition
and if the criteria are met, drops the condition and processes the next.
. Define *Discount Rate Location* field:
* If a *Condition Record* is selected, the discount % of the amount is
taken from the _Condition_ record.
* If a *Level Record* is selected, product quantity and discount should
be specified on the _Condition Level_ records.

*Advanced Calculation Method* can only be selected if *Level Records*
are set as a discount rate location.

After the ** _Condition_ record that matches all search criteria is
found, the system applies condition settings for discount calculation in
accordance with the selected Pricing Procedure. The process is repeated
until all _Calculation Type_ records are checked.

==== Discount Recalculation

When the discount calculation process is finished and the final price
with discount is applied, the system starts to track changes that can
occur in the order and restart discount calculation in some cases.
Discount recalculation in order happens in real-time and can be
triggered by the following:

. Product quantity change.
Each time you change the quantity of a product, the discount will be
recalculated.
. One of the fields affecting recalculation is changed:
* *Condition Recalculation Fields*
API names of fields, that if changed, trigger new condition search and
discount recalculation for the[.object]#Order Line Item#.
* **Discount Recalculation Fields
**API names of fields, that if changed trigger discount recalculation,
but no condition search.

The fields are specified in JSON format, similar to
the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/price-management/ref-guide/pricing-procedure-v-2/pricing-procedure-v-2-steps/the-sdk-step[SDK step syntax]. The fields from the
following objects can be used:
*[.apiobject]#Order#
*[.apiobject]#Delivery#
*[.apiobject]#OrderLineItem#
*[.apiobject]#DeliveryLineItem

#

[cols=",",]
|===
|image:warning.png[] | Some
fields cannot be used as recalculation triggers. See the full list
in xref:ct-orders-solution/general-limitations#h3_1020932784[this article].
|===

For example:
. The discount recalculation will be initiated when the following fields
are changed:
* The fields specified for the[.apiobject]#basePrice# key in
the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/price-management/ref-guide/pricing-procedure-v-2/pricing-procedure-v-2-steps/index[Pricing Procedure].
* The fields specified for the[.apiobject]#value# and
[.apiobject]#items# keys in the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/price-management/ref-guide/pricing-procedure-v-2/pricing-procedure-v-2-steps/the-set-value-step[Set
Value step].
* The fields specified for the[.apiobject]#condition# key in
the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/price-management/ref-guide/pricing-procedure-v-2/pricing-procedure-v-2-steps/step-conditions[Step Conditions].
