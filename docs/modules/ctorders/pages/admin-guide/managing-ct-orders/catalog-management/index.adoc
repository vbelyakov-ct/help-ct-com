= Catalog Management

The catalog management process includes building a structure of Marketing Catalogs, adding products, and defining catalogs availability. Catalogs are used by managers and sales representatives to create orders.

The *Catalog* page is implemented as a Lightning component with three tabs:

* The *Details* tab with the main catalog info.
* The <<h2_1817507152, Product Management>> tab consists of two sections. The left list section displays a list or hierarchy view of products available for adding to xref:./catalog-data-model/catalogs-field-reference.adoc[a catalog]. The right list section
displays products added to a catalog, which are represented as the
xref:./catalog-data-model/catalog-line-item-field-reference.adoc[Catalog Line Item] records.
* <<h2_457737850, Catalog Assignment>> tab consists of two sections. The left list section displays a list of xref:./catalog-data-model/catalogs-field-reference.adoc[catalogs]. In the right list section, assign catalogs for accounts.

== Product Management

The *Product Management* tab on the _Catalog_ record page allows you to create a hierarchy with sub-catalogs that include xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/product-management/index.adoc[products and product bundles].

* On the left side, the available catalogs and sub-catalogs are displayed as a list or according to hierarchy. Use the toggle to the appropriate view and the *Filter* button to sort and search.
* On the right side, create a hierarchy with sub-catalogs and specify products.

=== Filtering Options

include::partial$product-filtering-options.adoc[]

Create the *SKU* checkbox for the target [.object]#Product# object and specify it in
the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/object-setting-field-reference.adoc[Object Setting] record for the SF Instance. This property signifies that this product is a stock-keeping unit that can be added to catalogs.

[[h3_1395193200]]
==== Create a Hierarchy with Subcatalogs

To add products to catalogs, it is necessary to create xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/layout-setting-field-reference.adoc[a Layout Setting record] for the *Catalog Line Item* object.

NOTE: If a *Layout Setting* for the object is not found or no field is specified, the record ID will be displayed instead of a product name.

Click *Add new Catalog* to create a catalog and add sub-catalogs:

** When you add a sub-catalog, a lookup to the parent catalog is created for xref:./catalog-data-model/catalogs-field-reference.adoc[the sub-catalog record]. The
maximum levels in the catalog hierarchy are 4: 1 main {plus} 3 nested sub-catalogs.
** Products can be added only to the lowest level of a catalog, i.e., if a sub-catalog is created, you can add a product only to this sub-catalog. You can add a product to multiple sub-catalogs. If a catalog has at least one sub-catalog, no products can be added to a parent catalog directly; each product must be assigned to a sub-catalog.
** Added product is represented as xref:./catalog-data-model/catalog-line-item-field-reference.adoc[the Catalog Line Item record].

== Catalog Assignment

A created catalog can be available for a specific set of accounts or to all accounts in your instance by applying the *Available for all accounts* checkbox on the *Details* tab of the Catalog record page. In the latter case, the Sales Org selection field on the catalog settings will be inactive. Otherwise, you need to assign a catalog to accounts, which means creating xref:./catalog-data-model/catalog-assignment-field-reference.adoc[a Catalog Assignment record].

To display the *Catalog Assignment* tab on the layout, you need to configure xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/layout-setting-field-reference.adoc[a Layout Setting record] for the [.object]#Catalog Assignment# object. Drag and
drop catalogs to assign them to the selected _Account_ record.

If you selected multiple filters, accounts will be displayed that match all the selected criteria.

[[h3_1077652161]]
=== Dynamic Catalog Assignment

The CT solutions support a new feature that allows filtering catalogs available for a selected account dynamically. To apply dynamic search logic:

. Define the [.object]#Group# and [.object]#Group Member# objects of the CT package you work with (CT CPG, CT Pharma) in the xref:admin-guide/getting-started/setting-up-an-instance/configuring-object-setting.adoc[Object Settings].
. Create a lookup to the [.object]#Group# object of the CT package on the [.object]#Catalog# object.
. Make sure the catalog is NOT available for all accounts (checkbox is not selected).
. Create a dynamic group.
** xref:ctcpg:admin-guide/cpg-groups-management/create-and-update-a-dynamic-cpg-group.adoc[Create and Update a Dynamic CPG Group]
** xref:ctpharma:admin-guide/pharma-groups-management/create-and-update-a-dynamic-pharma-group.adoc[Create and Update a Dynamic Pharma Group]
. Assign a dynamic group, create a new _Settings_ record with the _Object Setting_ record type, and specify the referenced objects in *Group Object* and *Group Member Object* fields.

[[h2_1131344625]]
== Process Path

The following steps must be performed by the administrator to configure the catalogs for further usage:

. Create xref:admin-guide/getting-started/setting-up-an-instance/configuring-object-setting.adoc[the Object Setting record] for the SF Instance.
. Add xref:admin-guide/getting-started/setting-up-an-instance/creating-relationships-between-product-and-ct-orders-objects.adoc[lookups to a CT Product] object.
. xref:admin-guide/workshops/workshop-1-0-creating-basic-order/configuring-layout-settings-1-0/index.adoc[Configure Layout Settings] for [.object]#Catalog Line Item# and [.object]#Catalog Assignment# objects.
. xref:quick-start/creating-and-adding-catalogs-1-0.adoc[Create and manage catalogs].
. Assign catalogs if required.
