= Catalog Management

The catalog management process includes building a structure of
Marketing Catalogs, adding products, and defining catalogs availability.
Catalogs are used by managers and sales representatives to create
orders.

The *Catalog* page is implemented as a Lightning component with three
tabs:

* The *Details* tab with the main catalog info.
* The xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/catalog-management/catalog-management#h3_832302310[Product Management] tab
consists of two sections. The left list section displays a list or
hierarchy view of products available for adding to
xref:catalogs-field-reference[a catalog]. The right list section
displays products added to a catalog, which are represented as the
xref:catalog-line-item-field-reference[Catalog Line Item] records.
* The xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/catalog-management/catalog-management#h2_457737850[Catalog Assignment] tab
consists of two sections. The left list section displays a list of
xref:catalogs-field-reference[catalogs]. In the right list section,
assign catalogs for accounts.

==== 

The *Product Management* tab on the _Catalog_ record page allows you to
create a hierarchy with sub-catalogs that include
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/product-management/index[products and product bundles].

* On the left side, the available catalogs and sub-catalogs are
displayed as a list or according to hierarchy. Use the toggle to the
appropriate view and the *Filter* button to sort and search.
* On the right side, create a hierarchy with sub-catalogs and specify
products.

==== Filtering Options

* 

Create the *SKU* checkbox for the
target [.object]#Product# object and specify it in
the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/object-setting-field-reference[Object Setting] record for
the SF Instance. This property signifies that this product is a
stock-keeping unit that can be added to catalogs.

==== Create a Hierarchy with Subcatalogs

To add products to catalogs, it is necessary to create
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/layout-setting-field-reference[a Layout Setting record] for
the *Catalog Line Item* object.

If a *Layout Setting* for the object is not found or no field is
specified, the record ID will be displayed instead of a product name.

Click *Add new Catalog* to create a catalog and add sub-catalogs:
** When you add a sub-catalog, a lookup to the parent catalog is created
for xref:catalogs-field-reference[the sub-catalog record]. The
maximum levels in the catalog hierarchy are 4: 1 main {plus} 3 nested
sub-catalogs.
** Products can be added only to the lowest level of a catalog, i.e., if
a sub-catalog is created, you can add a product only to this
sub-catalog. You can add a product to multiple sub-catalogs. If a
catalog has at least one sub-catalog, no products can be added to a
parent catalog directly; each product must be assigned to a
sub-catalog.
** Added product is represented as
xref:catalog-line-item-field-reference[the Catalog Line Item
record].

=== Catalog Assignment

A created catalog can be available for a specific set of accounts or to
all accounts in your instance by applying the *Available for all
accounts* checkbox on the *Details* tab of the Catalog record page. In
the latter case, the Sales Org selection field on the catalog settings
will be inactive. Otherwise, you need to assign a catalog to accounts,
which means creating xref:catalog-assignment-field-reference[a
Catalog Assignment record].



To display the *Catalog Assignment* tab on the layout, you need to
configure xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/layout-setting-field-reference[a Layout Setting
record] for the[.object]#Catalog Assignment# object. Drag and
drop catalogs to assign them to the selected _Account_ record.

If you selected multiple filters, accounts will be displayed that match
all of the selected criteria.

[[h3_1077652161]]
==== Dynamic Catalog Assignment

The CT solutions support a new feature that allows filtering catalogs
available for a selected account dynamically. To apply dynamic search
logic:
. Define the[.object]#Group# and[.object]#Group
Member# objects of the CT package you work with (CT CPG, CT Pharma) in
the xref:admin-guide/getting-started/setting-up-an-instance/configuring-object-setting[Object Settings].
. Create a lookup to the[.object]#Group# object of the CT
package on the[.object]#Catalog# object.
. Make sure the catalog is NOT available for all accounts (checkbox is
not selected).
. Create a dynamic group.

and Update a Dynamic CPG Group]
** https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-pharma-publication/create-and-update-a-dynamic-pharma-group[Create
and Update a Dynamic Pharma Group]
. Assign a dynamic group, create a new _Settings_ record with
the _Object Setting_ record type, and specify the referenced objects
in *Group Object* and *Group Member Object* fields.

=== Process Path

The following steps must be performed by the administrator to configure
the catalogs for further usage:
. Create xref:admin-guide/getting-started/setting-up-an-instance/configuring-object-setting[the Object Setting record]
for the SF Instance.
. Add
xref:admin-guide/getting-started/setting-up-an-instance/creating-relationships-between-product-and-ct-orders-objects[lookups
to a CT Product] object.
. xref:configuring-layout-settings-1-0[Configure Layout Settings]
for *Catalog Line Item* and *Catalog Assignment* objects.
. xref:quick-start/creating-and-adding-catalogs-1-0[Create and manage
catalogs].
. Assign catalogs if required.
