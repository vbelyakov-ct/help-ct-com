= CT Order Field Reference

The[.object]#CT Order# object is intended to store order data.
Each record represents an order with specific CT products from available
Catalogs, prices from Price Book according to pricing procedures and
discounts management, configured delivery dates, and order status.



You can specify additional fields for the advanced order, e.g., in case
of using delivery fees, create a roll-up summary field.



By default, the CT Order object has no record types. You can specify
record types according to your needs and create the
specific link:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/layout-setting-field-reference[Layout
Settings] record for each record type.
