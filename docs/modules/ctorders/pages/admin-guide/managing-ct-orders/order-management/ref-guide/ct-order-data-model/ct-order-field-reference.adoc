= CT Order Field Reference

The [.object]#CT Order# object is intended to store order data. Each record represents an order with specific CT products from available Catalogs, prices from Price Book according to pricing procedures and discounts management, configured delivery dates, and order status.

You can specify additional fields for the advanced order, e.g., in case of using delivery fees, create a roll-up summary field.

By default, the [.object]#CT Order# object has no record types. You can specify record types according to your needs and create the specific xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/layout-setting-field-reference.adoc[Layout Settings] record for each record type.
