current _Sales Organization_ are displayed. Products are arranged
according to their order number (if given) or in alphabetical order.

Price] are specified for the _CT Product_ record. ====

=== Managing Products in Cart

Switch between *Catalogs* and *Promotion* tabs to select products and
add them to the order cart.

* Add one product, several products, or the whole catalog / sub-catalog
/ promotions. The *Disable Mass Adding* option on a _Catalog_ record
defines whether a sales rep can add a whole catalog to the order cart.
** Select products and click the *Add* button.
** Use drag-and-drop to manage products in the catalogs, promotions, and
order cart.
* All products from the selected catalog or promotion will be
automatically selected too.
* All catalog products are gathered under the *Catalogs* section.
* Promotion products are grouped separately under their respective
*Promotion* names. The promotion sales and delivery dates are displayed
next to the promotion. If the sales dates are empty, the delivery dates
will be displayed instead of them.

When you add a product from a catalog, the product is no longer
available for adding from any catalog. However, if you add a product
from a promotion, it will still be available from other promotions, if
those promotions' conditions match the order settings.

You can delete products from a cart:

* each product individually;
* all products added from catalogs;
* all products from a selected promo.

[[h3__412069062]]
==== Order Cart Layout

The *Order Cart* page consists of the following parts:

image:order-cart-layout.png[]

* *(1)* The main cart area with the configured columns
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/order-management/ref-guide/ct-order-data-model/order-line-item-field-reference.adoc[for Order Line Items] contains
read-only fields with the prices from the corresponding CT Price Book
and applied discounts, additional fields that are configured using the
layout setting.
[NOTE] ==== To form an order, it is necessary to configure the
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/layout-setting-field-reference[Object Settings] record with
the xref:configuring-layout-settings-1-0[Layout Setting] record
type. You can add read-only and editable fields affecting discount
calculation on the layout. ====
* *(2)* The bottom panel with overview metrics (optionally). To add the
desired fields, it is necessary to configure the Object Settings record
with the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/howtos/how-to-configure-totals-panel-setting[Totals Panel
Setting] record type. The maximum number of displayed fields is 4. If
the setting is not configured, xref:ct-order-field-reference[the
Total Price and Total Discount fields] are displayed by default.
* *(3)* The CT Order button controls.
xref:creating-a-delivery-1-0[]
** Click *Get Freebie* to
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/freebies-management/index#h2_1556344363[distribute freebies].
** Click *Add Delivery* to split products in the current order per
delivery dates and addresses.
** If the order has 140 *Delivery Line Items *or more, the *Calculate
Discounts* button appears to reduce the calculation time. Click the
button to calculate discounts and the total price.
By default, there are only two available split criteria: date and
address. You can add up to three more conditions
for xref:5-1-setting-up-a-delivery-split[splitting an order].
** Click *Save Draft* to save newly created order or changes in the
editing one. xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/order-management/index#h2_158967301[By default], the
*On Hold* stage will be set. Price calculations based on values in the
formula fields will be performed after clicking *Save Draft*.
** Click *Exit* if you do not want to save the current order or changes
made in the existing order.
** Click *Finalize* to restrict editing the current order.
If xref:5-2-setting-up-the-delivery-summary[the Delivery Summary
window] is set up, you can review and edit the delivery details after
clicking *Finalize*. For more information, refer
to xref:delivery-management#h2__1374863314[Delivery Summary].
* *(4)* xref:creating-a-delivery-1-0[The added delivery dates] with
the product quantity per delivery.
* To delete deliveries, click the drop-down arrow and select *Delete
delivery*.
If a _Delivery_ record was created for the order, you cannot delete all
deliveries from the order, at least one delivery should exist.

[[h3__1143528965]]
==== Editable Fields

The editable fields were implemented to support the application of the
manually set discounts and can be used in calculations or to display
additional information. These fields should be first created on the
[.object]#Order Line Item# object and then specified in the
Settings record with the
xref:order-line-item-layout-setting-1-0[Layout Setting] record
type.



The processing logic displaying the fields goes as follows:

. First, search the setting with the *Record Type* value matching the
xref:ct-order-field-reference[one] that was specified in the pop-up
window when the order was created.
. Then goes the setting with the *Sales Organization* field value
matching the one on the created order.
. If no settings were found, then the setting without the specified
*Record type* and *Sales organization* will be applied.



This logic takes into account the *Read-Only* and *Required* attributes
that could've been checked when the field was created. In that case,
these attributes will always come in higher priority regardless of the
values specified in the setting's *Read-Only Attributes* and *Required
Attributes*.



When the _Setting_ record is found, fields from the *Fields to display*
field of this record will be displayed on the right side of the order
cart layout. The attributes specified in the *Required Attributes* and
*Read-Only Attribute* will define whether the displayed field will be
mandatory to be filled before finalizing the order or have a read-only
status.
