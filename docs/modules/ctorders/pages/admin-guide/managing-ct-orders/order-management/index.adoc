=== Order Taking Overview

The *Order Life Cycle* allows using advanced sales strategies with
multiple conditions. The optional integration with ERP helps to easily
create orders based on all provided data.

* Order differentiation based on territories and roles in a company, as
well as the ability to customize the order page for each client.
* Set up comprehensive pricing procedures, long and short-term
promotions, and discounts based on different conditions.
* Define your order types or use the pre-configured ones to cover
specific needs per each client.
* Add the same products with different price conditions in one order,
for example, from an ordinary catalog or a short-term promotion.
* Specify bundles to add them with ordinary products in one order.
* Create multiple deliveries for several addresses based on the
available dates, products, and specific limits.
* Real-time calculation based on all provided details.
* Specify your order stages or re-use pre-configured ones to build order
processes according to the company needs.
* ​Apply validations to be sure to have the ability to correct all
order/delivery issues.

Order management allows you to create online and offline orders:

* Accept online orders at the call center or provide the customer access
to create online orders.
* Use field sales forces to create offline orders and then synchronize
all data from the CT Mobile app with CRM.
[.confluence-information-macro-information]#Offline orders are available
in CT Orders version 1.5 and higher.#

=== Order Types

The[.object]#CT Order# object has no record types by default.
You can specify record types according to your needs and create the
specific link:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/layout-setting-field-reference[Layout Settings]
record for each record type. In this case, when you create a CT Order
record, you should first select the record type and then the order type.

By default, the following order types are available:

* *Order*
Create a standard order and set up deliveries.
* *Return*
Select this type for an order that should be returned.
* **Pre-Sale
**Select this type for an order with CT Products that have not been
released to the public yet.

[[h2_158967301]]
=== Order Stages

There are several pre-configured stages, which are different for mobile
devices and Salesforce. The available stages:

* On-Hold
* Completed
* Finalized
* Validated

Create a custom flow and link:ct-order-field-reference[add new
stages] to match your business flow. Consider the following:

* The standard flow does not include the _Validated_ stage.
* The _Completed_ and _Finalized_ stages cannot be overridden.

[[h3_1884354907]]
==== Online Order in Salesforce

link:online-order[When a user creates a new online order] and
clicks the *Save Draft* button on the order details page, the order
moves to the _On-Hold_ stage. It marks that the current order could have
been saved with errors, for example:

* Delivery dates in the past for orders with the _Return_ order type.
* ​Products from expired promotions or not available catalogs.
* A not specified number of products for deliveries.



When a user clicks the *Finalize* button on the order details page, the
current order will be validated. If it met all validations, it moves to
the _Finalized_ stage, will be locked, and cannot be edited anymore.

You can create business logic to send finalized orders to the ERP system
if applied.

* All products in the order are from available (and optionally assigned
for the current Sales Organization) catalogs and promotions.
* The delivery rules are applied.
* All corresponding discounts are applied.

[[h3_1058643383]]
==== Offline Order in the CT Mobile app

link:offline-order[When a user creates a new offline order] and
clicks the *Save Draft* button on the order details screen, the order
moves to the *On-Hold* stage. It marks that the current order could have
been saved with errors, the same as in Salesforce.



When a user clicks the *Complete* button on the order details screen,
the current order will be validated, and if it met all validations, it
moves to the *Completed* stage.

[WARNING] ==== Do not manually change the *Stage* value on the
[.object]#Order ==== record screen to avoid missing
validations.#

Once completed, an order cannot be edited on a mobile device. Perform a
synchronization to edit if necessary and finalize the order in
Salesforce. Also, finalized orders received from Salesforce cannot be
edited on the mobile device.
