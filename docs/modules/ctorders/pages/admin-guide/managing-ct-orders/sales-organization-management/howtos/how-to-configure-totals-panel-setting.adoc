= How to Configure Totals Panel Setting

You can also configure the Totals Panel to display *Total Price* and
*Total Discount* per each delivery:

. Create a custom field on the [.object]#CT Order# object you
want to add to the Totals Panel. For example, let's create a formula
field that will show the total price excluding the discounted amount:

. Go to *Settings* and click *New*.
. In the *New Settings* window, select *Totals Panel Setting*.
. Configure the setting as follows:
* Leave the *Sales Organization* field empty, if you want to apply the
setting across all Sales Organizations.
* *Object*: orders__Delivery__c.
* *Fields To Display*:
[.apiobject]#orders__TotalPrice__c,orders__TotalDiscount__c#.
* *Labels*:[.apiobject]#Delivery Price, Delivery Discount#.
