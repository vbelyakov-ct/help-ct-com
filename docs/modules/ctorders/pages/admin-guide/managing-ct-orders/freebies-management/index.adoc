= Freebies Management
:toc:

_Freebie_ is a free-of-charge product that can be granted for products added from _Catalogs_ or _Promotions_ and added to the order cart as a gift when a customer meets the conditions for receiving freebies for a set of paid products.

Freebies are added or removed from the cart manually by a sales rep during the xref:admin-guide/workshops/workshop-3-0-working-with-freebies/workshop-3-0-checkpoint.adoc[order creation] process.

To use freebies, create a xref:admin-guide/getting-started/setting-up-an-instance/creating-relationships-between-product-and-ct-orders-objects.adoc[lookup to CT Product] from the [.object]#Freebie Line Item# object and check that the freebie product is active and has _Price Book Line Item_ records.

NOTE: xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/product-management/managing-bundles.adoc[Bundles] can also be added as freebies, excluding those with *Set Quantity On* = _Header_.

== Freebie Type Record Types

CT Orders provides two record types of _Freebie Type_:

* *Prioritized*
+
The system applies _Freebie Condition_ records that have the lowest or highest order number among multiple records that match the criteria.
* *Selective*
+
The system applies all _Freebie Condition_ records that match the criteria.

NOTE: Only one selective and one priority _Freebie Type_ record can be used for one _Sales Organization_ at a time. It is recommended to avoid linking two records of the same _Freebie Type_ with one _Sales Organization_ to avoid incorrect freebie calculations.

The *Freebie Type* window page has the main information *(1)* of the current xref:./freebie-data-model/freebie-type-field-reference.adoc[Freebie Type] record and related _Freebie Condition_ *(2)* and _Sales Organization_ *(3)* records.

image::2021-09-09_13-06-12.png[align="center"]

Each _Freebie Type_ includes a set of conditions that should be applied to calculate the number of freebies available for each order. Freebies are added to the order cart depending on a principle selected in the *Adding Method* field:

* *Similar*
+
The same product for which the condition is applied will be granted as a freebie.
* *Criteria Based*
+
Apply if you want to grant a product specified with SOQL filter considering all conditions for the selected _Freebie Type_ record, for example, only products of a specified brand.
* *List Based*
+
Apply when you want to grant a specific product selected on the _Freebie Line Item_ record related to a [.object]#Freebie Condition#.
+
TIP: It is possible to set quantity on a _Product_ record, while for other methods you can only set the minimum or maximum quantity on their respective levels.

== Freebies Calculation Process

The calculation process for freebies is similar to the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/index.adoc#h2_1585481109[Discount Calculation process]. The rules which are used for calculation are manifested in the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/freebies-management/freebie-data-model/freebie-condition-field-reference/index.adoc[Freebie Condition] child records and filtered and applied one by one in a distinct order.

. Create a new order and add a required number of products to your cart.
. The system checks the mapping on the _Settings_ record with the xref:admin-guide/getting-started/setting-up-an-instance/configuring-object-setting.adoc[Object Setting] record type to determine the object which contains the product *Quantity* field.
. The system checks if _Freebie Type_ records exist for the _Sales Organization_ and specified _Order Type_.
+
NOTE: The _Freebie Condition_ record for the applied _Freebie Type_ must have at least one _Freebie Level_ record.
. The system checks that all fields in the *Condition Fields List* field (on the applied _Freebie Type_) are accessible for a current user. If at least one field is not accessible, freebies will not be available for the order.
+
The *Condition Fields List* field is filled out automatically with the values pulled from the *Condition Details* fields on the _Freebie Condition_ child records. The field update is performed in one of two possible ways, depending on the option selected in the *Condition Fields Update Type* field.
+
include::partial$snippet-formula-fields-not-supported.adoc[]
. After a _Freebie Type_ is successfully processed, the system analyzes each _Freebie Condition_ record related to the _Freebie Type_:
.. The system checks _Freebie Level_ and _Freebie Line Item_ (only for the *List Based* method) records.
.. A list of products granting freebies is compiled from suitable _Order Line Items_.
.. The *Condition Details* field on the _Freebie Condition_ record is parsed.
+
image:calculation-types-2021-08-27.png[]
If a *Criteria Based* method is selected for this _Freebie Condition_, the *Criteria Details* field is parsed.
+
image:calculation-types-2021-08-27-1.png[]
.. All _Freebie Level_ child records are analyzed. If no _Freebie Level_ record is found for a condition, this _Freebie Condition_ will be skipped.

=== Processing records with the Similar Adding Method

Freebies quantity is set based on the values in the *Freebies Quantity Min* and *Freebies Quantity Max* field on a _Freebie Level_. If the *Proportional* checkbox is selected, the *Product Ratio* and *Freebie Ratio* fields are considered in the calculation.

The *Freebie Ratio* field defines the maximum number of freebies available for a number of products that are already in your cart. Meanwhile, *Freebies Quantity Max* specifies the number of freebies for the whole level.

A freebie is granted when the number of paid products in the order cart reaches the value specified in the *Starting From* field. For this method, products for each _Freebie Level_ are calculated separately for each paid product that matches the conditions in the *Condition Details* field.

[[h3_758219686]]
=== Processing Records with List Based Adding Method

An additional _Freebie Line Item_ record should be created for each product you want to grant as a freebie. The freebie is specified in the *Product* field. In the *Freebie Level* field, you can also define if the freebies should be calculated proportionally or by maximum and minimum values.

The product quantity and proportionality are defined on _Freebie Level_ records the same way as for other methods. You can set a quantity of each freebie for each level by adding _Freebie Level Line Items_.

Products for each _Freebie Level_ are calculated per group of products that match the conditions in the *Condition Details* field.

[[h3_972561451]]
=== Processing Records with Criteria Based Adding Method

This adding method calculation resembles a *Similar* method, but the list of products that can be granted as freebies is taken from the *Criteria Details* field.

The SOQL request for the [.object]#CT Product# object provides a dynamic search among the specified object records and other related objects with fields of the _Lookup_ type to [.object]#CT Product#. The system compiles a list of all products that matched the
criteria. For this method, products for each _Freebie Level_ are calculated per group of products that match the conditions in the *Condition Details* field.

== Freebies Distribution

[[h3_599666667]]
=== Auto-update

Freebies are automatically distributed. Open the *Freebies* window by clicking on the *Get Freebie* button while in the order cart, and the system will calculate and distribute the correct amount among available freebies where possible.

The following auto-update logic is implemented:

* Fully automated distribution is applied in case when a specific _Freebie Line Item_ reaches freebies minimum quantity and/or the proportionality condition is met. For example, a _Freebie Condition_ with the following settings:
** the *Similar* adding method
** *Proportional* is active
** *Ratio* of Product/Freebie is *12:1*

image::about-ct-vision-2021-08-25.png[align="center"]

* Freebies update after changing product quantity: freebies that no longer fit the order conditions will be automatically removed.
* If the *Delivery Control* is active, automatically distribute freebies to the first or last delivery when deliveries are created or deleted.
** This option is selected in the _Freebie Condition_ setup and defined in the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/freebies-management/freebie-data-model/freebie-condition-field-reference/index.adoc[Freebie Condition].
+
image:2021-08-26_12-36-46.png[]
* If the *Delivery Control* is inactive, all freebies that can be automatically distributed are added to the first delivery by default. You can distribute *List Based* and *Criteria Based* freebies if more than 2 freebies are available between deliveries as desired.
* For group *List Based* or *Criteria Based* freebies when more than one product matches the condition criteria, you need to manually distribute available freebies amount in the delivery or deliveries, if *Delivery Control* is off. When the maximum for the group is reached, all empty cells are locked out. If you enter more than allowed by the *Freebie
Quantity Max* field on the _Freebie Condition Level_, the error will display, and you'll need to manually fix the number of distributed freebies.

The order cannot be finalized if the freebies in order are not relevant. To recalculate and update Freebies:

. Click *Get Freebies* in the order cart to open the *Freebies* window.
. Click *Save* to apply distribution changes.

[[h3_676523153]]
=== Multiplier

xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/order-management/multiplicator.adoc[As paid products], you can specify whether freebies must be added to the order cart in a multiple of a specific value. On the corresponding product, activate the *Use Freebie
Multiplier* checkbox and specify the quantity in the *Units in Package* field.

NOTE: The multiplicity works only for the product per one delivery.

When you add a freebie to the order cart:

. The system checks whether the *Freebie Multiplier* is toggled on. If no, the multiplier is not in use.
. If the *Freebie Multiplier* is toggled on, the system checks a value in the *Unit In Package* field:
* For an empty field or when the value is zero, the multiplier is 1.
* If the value is other than 0 then the freebie quantity in the *Quantity* field on the _Delivery Line Item_ must be a multiple of a number specified in the *Unit In Package* field.

In the *Freebie* window, the quantity will be rounded to a multiple of the value, regardless of whether you manually specify the quantity or xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/freebies-management/index.adoc#h3_599666667[the value is automatically filled in].

=== Freebie Value and Level Formula

[NOTE]
====
Available for instances with the enabled xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/web-service/index.adoc[Web Service].

For more information about using the *Level Formula* field for _Freebies_, refer to xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/freebies-management/freebie-data-model/freebie-condition-field-reference/freebie-condition-levelformula-c-field-specification.adoc[].
====

Admins may assign different values for freebie products. For example, one freebie might be worth 3 points and another 1 point. The value of a freebie determines how many freebies are distributed for each _Freebie Level_.

To set the value, specify the path to the field on the corresponding [.object]#Product# object in the *Freebie Value* field of the [.object]#Freebie Condition# object, for example, [.apiobject]#CTCPG\__ParentId__r.Value__c#.

If the *Freebie Value* is set.

* On the [.object]#Freebie Level# object, if there are no records of _Freebie Line Items_:
** The quantity in the *Freebies Quantity Min* will be divided by *Freebie Value* if the *Similar* adding method is set for the _Freebie Condition_. In the case of *List Based* or *Criteria Based* adding method, the division is applied only if one freebie is distributed.
** The quantity in the *Freebies Quantity Max* will always be divided by *Freebie Value*.
** The quantity calculated according to *Freebie Ratio* will always be divided by *Freebie Value*.
* On the [.object]#Freebie Line Item# object, If the *List Based* adding method is set for the _Freebie Condition_: The *Freebie Quantity Max* and *Freebie Quantity Min* will be divided by the value of the *Freebie Value* field.

[NOTE]
====
* The result of dividing the minimum freebie quantity is rounded upwards.
* The result of dividing the maximum freebie quantity is rounded down.
* It is not recommended to use *Freebie Value* __ if the same value for the minimum and maximum amount of product is set for _Freebie Level_, as this can lead to a validation error.
