= Delivery Management

Delivery Management is a convenient tool for splitting the product
deliveries per date according to the Account strategy and the available
time slots.

If you use customer ERP {plus} Salesforce CRM, you can inherit the
delivery settings from ERP.

=== CT Order and Delivery Relationship

When tapping the *Add Cart* button on the selected CT Order, the user
can xref:creating-a-delivery-1-0[specify preferred delivery dates
and the number of deliveries].

* By default, the user cannot specify more than 19 deliveries. You can
reduce the number of deliveries on the appropriate ** _Limit Setting_
record.
* ​The delivery date range can be specified in the appropriate _Limit
Setting_ record.
* If only one delivery address is available, the *Add Address* field
will be filled out. If several addresses are available, select the
corresponding one.
* ​For each delivery, the _Delivery_ record with the date of delivery and
the _Delivery Line Item_ record with the quantity of CT Products will be
created.



​You can add *Deliveries* to the *CT Order* layout.

=== Order Split

The Order Split feature is used for distributing products between
multiple deliveries. This allows your company to create deliveries that
meet logistic and financial conditions and requirements and make the
order taking process more efficient and apparent. The split rules are
commonly based on the following conditions:

* How company delivers products: from different warehouses, different
suppliers, different types of products, etc.
* How company bills customers.

[[h3_2053162833]]
==== The Split Logic

The Order Split logic affects the following objects:

*[.object]#Order#
*[.object]#Order Line Item#
[NOTE] ==== Any field on the [.object]#Order Line Item
==== or its parent objects that cannot be changed by an external logic,
such as formulas, rollup-summary fields, process builder, apex, etc.,
can be used as criteria for splitting products between deliveries during
order taking.#
*[.object]#Delivery#
*[.object]#Delivery Line Item#



To set up Order Split, create a _Settings_ record with the _Split
Settings_ record type.

. When a product is added to order cart, the system defines which
deliveries should be created according to the values in the *Split
Fields* and *Split Parameters Path* fields.
. The system creates required _Deliveries_ and _Delivery Line Items_ for
each _Order Line Item_ record.
* All child products in a bundle inherit the parent's split criteria and
hence are distributed to their parent's product delivery.
* Freebies are split the same way as paid products.
. If you remove a product from order cart, the corresponding _Delivery
Line Item_ record will also be deleted. If no _Delivery Line Item_
exists for a delivery, the delivery will be cancelled.
After the order finalization, the actual _Delivery Line Item_ records
and deliveries will be updated after changing products and their
quantity in the cart.

=== Process Path

The following steps must be performed by the administrator in order to
configure order deliveries:
[NOTE] ==== A representative should have at least permission to
read records and all fields of the
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/index[Settings] object. Users with the
manager role can also have permission to edit records. ====

. Add the custom[.object]#Address# object if needed.
A representative should have permission to read the custom
[.object]#Address# object. Users with the manager role can also
have permission to edit _Address_ records.
. xref:admin-guide/getting-started/setting-up-an-instance/configuring-object-setting[Create] the _Settings_ record
with the _Object Setting_ record type for an instance.
. xref:configuring-an-address-settings-1-0[Create] the _Settings_
record with the _Address Setting_ record type.
. xref:creating-a-relationship-between-custom-address-object-and-delivery-1-0[Add
the address lookup] on the [.object]#Delivery# object.
A representative should have permission to create, edit, and delete the
_Delivery_ and _Delivery Line Item_ records.
. Optionally,
xref:adding-delivery-restrictions-to-an-order-1-0[create] and set
up the _Settings_ record with the _Limit Settings_ record type for an
_Order_ record type.
. xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/promotions[Set up Promotions and promotion delivery dates].
* A representative should have permission to read the
[.object]#Promotion# object. Users with the manager role can
also have permission to edit _Promotion_ records.
* If xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/promotion-data-model/promotion-field-reference[the delivery dates specified on
the Promotion record] are out
of xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/limit-setting-field-reference[the delivery dates in the
Limit Settings record], the order delivery with the products of this
