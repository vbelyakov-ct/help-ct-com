= Price Management

Price management means implemented in the package are based on the
calculation algorithm set in _Pricing Procedure_ and _Calculation Type_
records with specified rules and conditions that are applied during the
calculation.

Please, refer to the link:discount-management[Discount
Management] articles to see the full discount and price calculation
object model.

=== Price Calculation Workflow

Before getting into details on the configuration of _Pricing Procedure_
and _Calculation Types_, let's explore the overall pricing workflow that
is performed by the new CT Orders advanced pricing engine:

==== Discount Calculation Requirements

To successfully calculate a discount, the following conditions must be
maintained throughout the pricing procedure:

. _List Prices_ are created for each
link:delivery-line-item-field-reference[Delivery Line Item] in the
order.
. The _Pricing Procedure_ is defined for an order.
* The[.apiobject]#orders__PricingProcedure__с# field is
specified on the object for the _Sales Organization_ and _Order Type_ in
the order.
* The _Pricing Procedure_ is active.
. link:calculation-types[Calculation Type] is linked to the applied
_Pricing Procedure_, and _Calculation Type_ is included in the JSON
formula.
* The *Calculation Method*, *Unit of Measure*, and *External Id* fields
are filled out.
. All fields specified in the **Condition Fields List**​ field must be
accessible to a current user.
. _Condition_ or _Group And Condition_ record type exists for this
_Calculation Type_.

[[h1_644400073]]
=== Pricing Procedure

The pricing procedure is carried out with the help of the
link:pricing-procedure-fields-reference[Pricing Procedure] object,
which determines the methods and sequence of price calculation
procedures for each order.

* The *Pricing Procedure* field on this object contains calculation
algorithm steps in JSON format.
* The pricing procedure can be set up differently for each _Sales
Organization_ and _Order Type_.

The mobile user must have at least read access to the fields in the
link:pricing-procedure-fields-reference[Pricing Procedure] or
link:discount-management#h3__1225315997[recalculation fields] to
calculate *Total Price*. Otherwise, the total price will be calculated
by the *List Price* fields.

Price is calculated for each _Delivery Line Item_ record based on the
quantity entered on each _Delivery Line Item_ or _Order Line Item_
record and conditions specified in the applied _Calculation Type_.
Depending on the type of product, the system applies specific rules for
discount calculation. For bundles, there are
link:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/product-management/index[three possible calculation scenarios], for
products the discount is applied to each product record.



To provide a link between _Pricing Procedure_ and _Calculation Types_,
the[.object]#Procedure Calculation Type# junction object is
introduced. The _Procedure Calculation Type_ records are created
automatically for all _Calculation Types_ specified in the Pricing
Procedure formula. 



The following procedure versions are supported:

* link:pricing-procedure-v-1[Pricing Procedure v. 1.0] requires
only the *Procedure* step, as in previous CT Orders versions. In this
step, a formula is used to calculate the price of each _Delivery Line
Item_ by applying different discount _Calculation Types_ listed in a
sequence with[.apiobject]#MAX#, MIN, MULT, or SUM operators. 
* link:pricing-procedure-v-2-steps[Pricing Procedure v. 2.0]
requires all steps of the price calculation to be specified in the JSON
formula.

Type* record in the JSON formula.
