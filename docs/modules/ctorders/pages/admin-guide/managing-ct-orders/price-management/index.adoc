= Price Management
:toc:

Price management means implemented in the package are based on the calculation algorithm set in _Pricing Procedure_ and _Calculation Type_ records with specified rules and conditions that are applied during the calculation.

Please, refer to the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/index.adoc[Discount Management] articles to see the full discount and price calculation object model.

== Price Calculation Workflow

Before getting into details on the configuration of _Pricing Procedure_ and _Calculation Types_, let's explore the overall pricing workflow that is performed by the new CT Orders advanced pricing engine:

=== Discount Calculation Requirements

To successfully calculate a discount, the following conditions must be maintained throughout the pricing procedure:

. _List Prices_ are created for each xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/delivery-management/delivery-line-item-field-reference.adoc[Delivery Line Item] in the order.
. The _Pricing Procedure_ is defined for an order.
* The [.apiobject]#orders\__PricingProcedure__с# field is
specified on the object for the _Sales Organization_ and _Order Type_ in the order.
* The _Pricing Procedure_ is active.
.  xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/calculation-types.adoc[Calculation Type] is linked to the applied _Pricing Procedure_, and _Calculation Type_ is included in the JSON formula.
* The *Calculation Method*, *Unit of Measure*, and *External Id* fields are filled out.
. All fields specified in the *Condition Fields List* field must be accessible to a current user.
. _Condition_ or _Group And Condition_ record type exists for this _Calculation Type_.

== Pricing Procedure

The pricing procedure is carried out with the help of the xref:./ref-guide/pricing-procedure-fields-reference.adoc[Pricing Procedure] object, which determines the methods and sequence of price calculation procedures for each order.

* The *Pricing Procedure* field on this object contains calculation algorithm steps in JSON format.
* The pricing procedure can be set up differently for each _Sales Organization_ and _Order Type_.

NOTE: The mobile user must have at least read access to the fields in the xref:./ref-guide/pricing-procedure-fields-reference.adoc[Pricing Procedure] or xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/index.adoc#h3_1225315997[recalculation fields] to calculate *Total Price*. Otherwise, the total price will be calculated by the *List Price* fields.

Price is calculated for each _Delivery Line Item_ record based on the quantity entered on each _Delivery Line Item_ or _Order Line Item_ record and conditions specified in the applied _Calculation Type_.

Depending on the type of product, the system applies specific rules for discount calculation. For bundles, there are xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/product-management/index.adoc[three possible calculation scenarios], for products the discount is applied to each product record.

To provide a link between _Pricing Procedure_ and _Calculation Types_, the [.object]#Procedure Calculation Type# junction object is introduced. The _Procedure Calculation Type_ records are created automatically for all _Calculation Types_ specified in the Pricing Procedure formula.

The following procedure versions are supported:

* xref:./ref-guide/pricing-procedure-v-1/index.adoc[Pricing Procedure v. 1.0] requires only the *Procedure* step, as in previous CT Orders versions. In this step, a formula is used to calculate the price of each _Delivery Line Item_ by applying different discount _Calculation Types_ listed in a sequence with [.apiobject]#MAX#, [.apiobject]#MIN#, [.apiobject]#MULT#, or [.apiobject]#SUM# operators.
* xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/price-management/ref-guide/pricing-procedure-v-2/pricing-procedure-v-2-steps/index.adoc[Pricing Procedure v. 2.0] requires all steps of the price calculation to be specified in the JSON formula.

NOTE: Use the [.apiobject]#ExternalId__с# value of the _Calculation Type_ record in the JSON formula.
