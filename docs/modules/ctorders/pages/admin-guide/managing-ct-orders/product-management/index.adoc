= Product Management

Administrators set up products that are assembled into
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/catalog-management/index.adoc[Catalogs] and
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/promotions.adoc[Promotions], and sales representatives used them
for xref:workshop1-0-creating-basic-order[creating orders]. You can
use the standard[.object]#Salesforce Product# object as your
products, or set up CT Orders integration with the CT CPG or CT Pharma
target package to enrich your product management process.

=== Workflow Overview

First, define a[.object]#Product# object to use in the system.

* Determine an *SKU* property of the [.object]#Product# object
by creating a _Settings_ record with the _Object Settings_ record type.
This attribute signifies that a product is the smallest stock unit for
sale that can be used to comprise higher-level items (product bundles)
and compile orders.

* Specify *Units in Package*—a ratio that defines the quantity of
product to add in the order by one tap.
* Set up bundles and a ratio for multiplying a component quantity in the
bundle if needed.
[NOTE] ==== the [.object]#Product Component ==== object
is required for this feature and available in case of integration with
CT CPG or CT Pharma package.#
* Set up xref:ct-price-book-field-reference[CT Price Books] and
*List Prices* for each
product—xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/product-management/product-data-model/ct-price-book-line-item-field-reference.adoc[CT Price Book
Line Item].



The list of products is managed in the *Product Management* section on
the *Catalogs* and *Promotions* tabs. Here you can add products and
build a catalog hierarchy with products and bundles:

Created catalogs and promotions are then used by sales representatives
for filling in the order cart:

=== Managing Products Quantity

To manage quantity per delivery for each paid product, add *Min Quantity
Per Delivery*, *Max Quantity Per Delivery*, and *Multiplier* fields to
the _Product_ and _Price Book Line Item_ page layouts.

Min/max values specified on a[.object]#Price Book Line Item#
object are prioritized over a _Product_ object record.

* If the values are set, when you add a product to the order cart, the
minimum quantity value will be displayed automatically. If you enter a
value outside the specified range, the system will automatically round
the number to the value either *Max Quantity Per Delivery* or *Min
Quantity Per Delivery* field.
* The same rules are applied for products in bundles in the case when
the *Set Quantity Level* field is set to[.object]#Product
Component#.[TIP] ==== For more information, refer to
xref:managing-bundles[Managing Bundles]. ====

[[h3_1789771621]]
==== Multiplying Product Component Quantity

The *Multiplier* field is added to the _Product Component_ layout to
specify a ratio for multiplying a component quantity in the bundle when
a bundle is added to the order cart. For example:



[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",]
|===
|*Input Data* |*Operation* |*Result*
a|
Set Quantity Level = Header



A bundle has:

* Product A with Multiplier = 3
* Product B with Multiplier = 2

|Add 2 bundles to the order cart. a|
Bundle = 2

* Product A with Multiplier = 6
* Product B with Multiplier = 4

|===

=== Managing Product List Prices

Each _Product_ record must be assigned to a[.object]#CT Price
Book# and get a ** *List Price*.

* A single product can be available in several[.object]#CT
Price Books# and has different list prices.
* A[.object]#CT Price Book# can be assigned to the specific
*Sales Organization* or *Order Type*.



On the *CT Price Book* tab, add new[.object]#CT Price Book List
Items# for products that you are going to add to your catalogs or
promotions.

* Products without *List Prices* are not displayed in the list on the
*Catalog Product Management* tab and cannot be added to the order cart.
* You need to create[.object]#CT Price Book Line Items# with
*List Price* for the bundle header, even if the price is calculated on
bundle components. Otherwise, a bundle will not be added to the order
cart.

=== Process Path

. https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/compact-layout[Set
up the compact layout] for the [.object]#Product# object. The
title is the value of the first field in a compact layout, and the
subtitle is the value of the second field in a compact layout.
. Map objects in OM Settings:
* Select the [.object]#Product #object in a system.
* Select the [.object]#Product Component# object in a system.
* Specify a field to be used as an SKU-defining attribute of a product
record.
. xref:admin-guide/getting-started/setting-up-an-instance/creating-relationships-between-product-and-ct-orders-objects[Create
lookup fields for Product].

Prior to configuring products hierarchy and other product settings, you
need to link the [.object]#Product# child records with a number
of CT Orders objects by creating a lookup field for each of the
following objects:
*[.object]#Catalog Line Item#
*[.object]#Promo Line Item#
*[.object]#Order Line Item#
*[.object]#Freebie Line Item#
*[.object]#Price Book Line Item#
*[.object]#Delivery Line Item#
. xref:managing-bundles[Create and configure bundles].
. Configure product quantity per delivery using the *Max Product Per
Delivery* and *Min Product Per Delivery* fields for
[.object]#Product# and[.object]#CT Price Book Line
Item# records.
