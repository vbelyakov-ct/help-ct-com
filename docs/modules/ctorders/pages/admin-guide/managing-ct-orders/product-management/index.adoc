= Product Management
:toc:

Administrators set up products that are assembled into xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/catalog-management/index.adoc[Catalogs] and xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/promotions.adoc[Promotions], and sales representatives used them for xref:admin-guide/workshops/workshop1-0-creating-basic-order/index.adoc[creating orders]. You can use the standard [.object]#Salesforce Product# object as your products, or set up CT Orders integration with the CT CPG or CT Pharma target package to enrich your product management process.

== Workflow Overview

First, define a [.object]#Product# object to use in the system.

* Determine an *SKU* property of the [.object]#Product# object by creating a _Settings_ record with the _Object Settings_ record type. This attribute signifies that a product is the smallest stock unit for sale that can be used to comprise higher-level items (product bundles) and compile orders.
+

* Specify *Units in Package*—a ratio that defines the quantity of product to add in the order by one tap.
* Set up bundles and a ratio for multiplying a component quantity in the bundle if needed.
+
NOTE: The [.object]#Product Component# object is required for this feature and available in case of integration with CT CPG or CT Pharma package.
* Set up xref:./product-data-model/ct-price-book-field-reference.adoc[CT Price Books] and *List Prices* for each product—xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/product-management/product-data-model/ct-price-book-line-item-field-reference.adoc[CT Price Book Line Item].

The list of products is managed in the *Product Management* section on the *Catalogs* and *Promotions* tabs. Here you can add products and build a catalog hierarchy with products and bundles:

Created catalogs and promotions are then used by sales representatives for filling in the order cart:

== Managing Products Quantity

To manage quantity per delivery for each paid product, add *Min Quantity Per Delivery*, *Max Quantity Per Delivery*, and *Multiplier* fields to the _Product_ and _Price Book Line Item_ page layouts.

NOTE: Min/max values specified on a [.object]#Price Book Line Item# object are prioritized over a [.object]#Product# object record.

* If the values are set, when you add a product to the order cart, the minimum quantity value will be displayed automatically. If you enter a value outside the specified range, the system will automatically round the number to the value either *Max Quantity Per Delivery* or *Min Quantity Per Delivery* field.
* The same rules are applied for products in bundles in the case when the *Set Quantity Level* field is set to [.object]#Product Component#.

=== Multiplying Product Component Quantity

The *Multiplier* field is added to the _Product Component_ layout to specify a ratio for multiplying a component quantity in the bundle when a bundle is added to the order cart. For example:

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",]
|===
|*Input Data* |*Operation* |*Result*

a|Set Quantity Level = Header

A bundle has:

* Product A with Multiplier = 3
* Product B with Multiplier = 2

|Add 2 bundles to the order cart. a|Bundle = 2

* Product A with Multiplier = 6
* Product B with Multiplier = 4

|===

[[h2_718618717]]
== Managing Product List Prices

Each _Product_ record must be assigned to a [.object]#CT Price Book# and get a _List Price_.

* A single product can be available in several [.object]#CT Price Books# and has different list prices.
* A [.object]#CT Price Book# can be assigned to the specific _Sales Organization_ or _Order Type_.

On the *CT Price Book* tab, add new [.object]#CT Price Book List Items# for products that you are going to add to your catalogs or promotions.

* Products without _List Prices_ are not displayed in the list on the *Catalog Product Management* tab and cannot be added to the order cart.
* You need to create [.object]#CT Price Book Line Items# with _List Price_ for the bundle header, even if the price is calculated on bundle components. Otherwise, a bundle will not be added to the order cart.

Prior to configuring products hierarchy and other product settings, you need to link the [.object]#Product# child records with a number of CT Orders objects by creating a lookup field for each of the following objects:

* [.object]#Catalog Line Item#
* [.object]#Promo Line Item#
* [.object]#Order Line Item#
* [.object]#Freebie Line Item#
* [.object]#Price Book Line Item#
* [.object]#Delivery Line Item#
. xref:./managing-bundles.adoc[Create and configure bundles].
. Configure product quantity per delivery using the *Max Product Per Delivery* and *Min Product Per Delivery* fields for _Product_ and _CT Price Book Line Item_ records.
