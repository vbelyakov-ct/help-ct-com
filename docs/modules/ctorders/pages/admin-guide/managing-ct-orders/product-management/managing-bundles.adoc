= Managing Bundles

The _Bundle_ is a record of the [.object]#Product# object that has child productsâ€”related records of the [.object]#Product Components# object. For example, it can be a set of yogurts.

[NOTE]
====
* To work with bundles, a user must have access to the [.object]#Product Component# object
(in xref:ctcpg:admin-guide/ct-products-and-assortments-management/ref-guide/product-component-field-reference.adoc[CT CPG] or xref:ctpharma:admin-guide/pharma-products-management/product-component-field-reference.adoc[CT Pharma]) on xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/catalog-management/catalog-data-model/catalog-line-item-field-reference.adoc[Catalog Line Item] and xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/promotion-data-model/promotion-line-item-field-reference.adoc[Promotion Line Item].
* Since CT Orders 24R1, administrator must manually create the *Product Component* lookup field to the [.object]#Product Component# object (in xref:ctcpg:admin-guide/ct-products-and-assortments-management/ref-guide/product-component-field-reference.adoc[CT CPG] or xref:ctpharma:admin-guide/pharma-products-management/product-component-field-reference.adoc[CT Pharma]) on xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/catalog-management/catalog-data-model/catalog-line-item-field-reference.adoc[Catalog Line Item] and/or xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/discount-management/promotion-data-model/promotion-line-item-field-reference.adoc[Promotion Line Item] to work with bundles.

* A bundle can have up to 3 child bundles. Expand bundles to see all child bundles and products nested in them.
* The Bundle icon is displayed next to a product name. Click on the Bundle icon to open a pop-up with details about the bundle components.
* A bundle can be added to another bundle.

== Bundle Calculation Rules

The bundle price and quantity are calculated based on the values in the *Set Quantity On* and *Calculate Price On* fields on the _Product_ record.

NOTE: The *Multiplier* field on the _Product Component_ records affects product quantity in the order cart.

The bundle price will be obtained by multiplying the *List Price* by the *Quantity* of the parent product.

The minimum and maximum quantities on bundle components are *Read-Only*.

== Bundle Validation

The following validations take place:

* If the *Calculate Price On* field has the *Header* value, then the validation is applied only for a parent product.
* If the *Calculate Price On* field has the *Components* value, then the validation is applied to each bundle component. If it does not meet validation criteria, then the whole bundle cannot be added to the order cart. The alert with the product that failed validation will be displayed.
* If the *Set Quantity On* field has the *Header* value, then the sales rep is allowed to remove the whole bundle, but bundle components cannot be removed from the order cart.
* If the *Set Quantity On* field has the *Components* value, then the sales rep is allowed to remove the whole bundle or its components.
