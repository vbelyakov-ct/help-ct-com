= Managing Bundles

The *Bundle* is a record of the[.object]#Product# object that
has child productsâ€”related records of the[.object]#Product
Components# object. For example, it can be a set of yogurts.

To work with bundles, a user must have access to
the [.object]#Product Component# object
(in https://help.customertimes.com/smart/project-ct-cpg/product-component-field-reference[CT
CPG] or https://help.customertimes.com/smart/project-ct-pharma/product-component-field-reference[CT
Pharma]) on xref:catalog-line-item-field-reference[Catalog Line
Item] and xref:promotion-line-item-field-reference[Promotion Line
Item].

Since CT Orders 24R1, administrator must manually create the *Product
Component* lookup field to the [.object]#Product
Component# object
(in https://help.customertimes.com/smart/project-ct-cpg/product-component-field-reference[CT
CPG] or https://help.customertimes.com/smart/project-ct-pharma/product-component-field-reference[CT
Pharma]) on xref:catalog-line-item-field-reference[Catalog Line
Item] and/or xref:promotion-line-item-field-reference[Promotion
Line Item] to work with bundles.

child bundles and products nested in them.

Bundle icon to open a pop-up with details about the bundle components.

=== Bundle Calculation Rules

The bundle price and quantity are calculated based on the values in the
*Set Quantity On* and *Calculate Price On* fields on the *Product*
record.
[NOTE] ==== The *Multiplier* field on the *Product Component*
records affects product quantity in the order cart. ====

=== Bundle Validation

The following validations take place:

* If the *Calculate Price On* field has the *Header* value, then the
validation is applied only for a parent product.
* If the *Calculate Price On* field has the *Components* value, then the
validation is applied to each bundle component. If it does not meet
validation criteria, then the whole bundle cannot be added to the order
cart. The alert with the product that failed validation will be
displayed.
* If the *Set Quantity On* field has the *Header* value, then the sales
rep is allowed to remove the whole bundle, but bundle components cannot
be removed from the order cart.
* If the *Set Quantity On* field has the *Components* value, then the
sales rep is allowed to remove the whole bundle or its components.
