= Order Change Manager

Order Change Manager maintains the integrity of orders in the Salesforce
database. It allows Salesforce users to work with multiple order carts
on different tabs simultaneously, while for CT Mobile users, it tracks
all changes to the order cart and performs their successful submission
to the Salesforce database.

=== Overview

Order Change Manager is used for:

* Ensuring the integrity of orders saved in Salesforce.
* Loading all required CT Orders records with the specified conditions
to the CT Mobile app.
* Handling conflicts of simultaneous editing of the same order in
Salesforce and CT Mobile.
* Allows Salesforce users to simultaneously work with multiple order
carts on different
tabs. xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/order-management/ref-guide/user-permissions-for-offline-orders[Go to the
article] to view the required user permissions.



Order Change Manager uses a public method for Order Lightning Web
interface in Salesforce and a custom REST API for CT Mobile and controls
data integrity the following objects:

*[.object]#CT Order#
*[.object]#Order Line Item#
*[.object]#Delivery#
*[.object]#Delivery Line Item#
*[.object]#Calculated Discount#

=== Keeping Data Up-to-Date in Orders

When a mobile user performs a synchronization, orders that are available
for this user will be downloaded on the mobile device along with all
related records. If a user made changes to the order cart:

. REST API creates package(s) with changes for a specific _Order_ record
if any related records of that order have been changed, created, or
deleted.
.. Each package contains no more than 200 records for a particular
order.
.. If the total number of transferred object records exceeds 200
records, the order will be split into several packages, which are formed
according to that order:
...[.object]#Order#
...[.object]#Order Line Item#,[.object]#Delivery#
...[.object]#Delivery Line Item#,[.object]#Calculated
Discount#
.. Each _Order_ record is presented as a JSON file (flat list) in
package(s).
[TIP] ==== To learn more about JSON keys and view examples,
refer to xref:order-change-manager-json-examples-and-keys[Order
Change Manager: JSON Examples and Keys]. ====
. During the synchronization, REST API sends package(s) with changes to
the records of the following CT Orders objects to a designated
endpoint:[.apiobject]#{{Salesforce_instance_url}}/services/apexrest/ChangeManager#. The
standard CT Mobile functionality for iOS users, such
as https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/sync-recovery[Sync
Recovery], https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/conflict-manager-control[Conflict
Manager],
and https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/online-records-fetching[Online
Records Fetching], does not apply to those CT Orders objects.
. On the Salesforce side, the system creates an _Order Change Manager_
record for the particular [.object]#Order# and fills it out with
the received JSONs. If a previous _Order Change Manager_ record is
found, it will be deleted. For more information, refer
to xref:order-change-manager-field-reference[Order Change Manager
Field Reference].
. The xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/order-change-manager/order-change-manager[Order Change Manager] checks SOQL
queries received from CT Mobile. If the query contains a mobile
temporary record ID, Order Change Manager checks if there is a record
with the same value in the *Reference Id* field in Salesforce. If such a
record is found, Order Change Manager updates it. Otherwise, Order
Change Manager creates a new record.
. REST API gets a response from Salesforce:
* records are successfully saved;
* records are successfully copied;
* an error occurred.
. When a user closes the order cart, finalizes, or completes the order
in Salesforce, the corresponding _Order Change Manager_ record is
deleted.

=== Order Deduplication Logic

The deduplication logic allows you to handle conflicts and keep data
consistency of created orders and related object records. For this
purpose, the [.apiobject]#orders__ReferenceId__c# field
is created on the following objects:

*[.object]#Order#
*[.object]#Order Line Item#
*[.object]#Delivery#
*[.object]#Delivery Line Item#
*[.object]#Calculated Discount#

A mobile user should have permission to edit the *Reference Id* field on
all the following objects.

The *Reference Id* field stores the pair of record ID and user ID.

* If the record has not yet been transferred from CT Mobile, the field
contains the mobile temporary record ID and the user identifier.
For example,
[.apiobject]#a06-AF3AA67B-EA24-4DAB-9C8A-9B70357DAB830055J000001L7aTQAS#,
where[.apiobject]#a06-AF3AA67B-EA24-4DAB-9C8A-9B70357DAB83# is
the temporary record Id and[.apiobject]#0055J000001L7aTQAS# is
the user identifier.
* If the record was transferred to Salesforce, the field contains the
Salesforce record ID and the user identifier.
For example,[.apiobject]#a0g5w00000EQJi1AAH0055J000001L7aTQAS#,
where[.apiobject]#a0g5w00000EQJi1AAH# is the Salesforce record
ID and[.apiobject]#0055J000001L7aTQAS# is the user identifier.

==== Deduplication Logic for the Finalized Order

Sometimes, there are situations when the same order has different
statuses on the mobile device and in Salesforce because the mobile user
did not perform the fast synchronization. Use the additional option to
control whether to create a duplicate of the finalized order with all
related records in Salesforce, or update it if a mobile user made
changes to this order. For more information about the order stages,
refer to xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/order-management/index#h2_158967301[Order Stages].

For example, an order was downloaded to a mobile device and then
finalized in Salesforce. If, after finishing the order in Salesforce,
the mobile user did not run synchronization and made changes to the same
order in CT Mobile, a duplicate order will be created with all related
records in Salesforce during the next synchronization.



The administrator can change the default behavior using the *Turn Off
Closed Orders Duplication* checkbox on the appropriate
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/sales-organization-field-reference[Sales Organization] record.

* By default, the checkbox is disabled. A duplicate of the mobile order
will be created with all related records in Salesforce when a mobile
user edits this record on the mobile device. This logic does not affect
orders on the *On-Hold* stage in Salesforce.
* When the checkbox is selected, the finalized order is updated in
Salesforce if a mobile user has edited it in CT Mobile.

the option can cause conflicts in the case when there is the custom
business logic to send the finalized orders to ERP from Salesforce.

=== Salesforce: Public method

When a record is changed, Order Change Manager saves all changes in the
xref:order-change-manager-field-reference[Order Change Manager]
record. If a user closes the order cart, *Finalize* or *Complete* the
order in Salesforce or CT Mobile app, the corresponding *Order Change
Manager* record will be deleted.



To save changes in the Salesforce database, the public method is used in
the Order Lightning Web interface. When a user opens a *CT Order* record
in the Lightning Web interface in Salesforce:

. The data is received directly from the Salesforce database using the
SOQL queries.
. If allowed, the finalized order opens for editing. Otherwise, the
order is available in read-only mode.
. If the user makes changes and clicks *Save*, all data changes will be
prepared, added to the package(s), and saved to the Salesforce database.
â€‹
[NOTE] ==== While the order data is being saved, the Order Cart
interface is blocked, restricting new changes until the saving process
is complete. ====
* Each package contains no more than 200 records for a particular order.
* If the total number of transferred object records exceeds 200 records,
the order will be split into several packages, which are formed
according to that order:
**[.object]#Order#
**[.object]#Order Line Item#,[.object]#Delivery#
**[.object]#Delivery Line Item#,[.object]#Calculated
Discount#
* Changes for the order are stored in the *Order Change Manager* record,
which will be deleted when the user closes the order cart, finalize or
complete the order.
