= Order Change Manager Field Reference

the [.object]#Order Change Manager# object is responsible for
exchanging data about orders created, edited, and deleted in the CT
Mobile app, and maintaining the integrity of those orders in the
Salesforce database.

* During synchronization, CT Mobile sends change packets with all
related data of a particular *Order* record. Each order is represented
xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/order-change-manager/order-change-manager-json-examples-and-keys[as a JSON file].
* xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/order-change-manager/index#h2_1554146395[On the Salesforce side],
the system creates an *Order Change Manager* record for each order
received from CT Mobile during synchronization.
* The system splits the received JSON and populates the *Order Change
Manager* record fields with the split JSON based on the object name.
* When a user closes the order cart, finalizes, or completes the order,
the corresponding **Order Change Manage**r record is deleted.
