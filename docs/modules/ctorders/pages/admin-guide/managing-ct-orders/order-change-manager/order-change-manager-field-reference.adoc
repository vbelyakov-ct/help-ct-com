= Order Change Manager Field Reference

The [.object]#Order Change Manager# object is responsible for exchanging data about orders created, edited, and deleted in the CT Mobile app, and maintaining the integrity of those orders in the Salesforce database.

* During synchronization, CT Mobile sends change packets with all related data of a particular _Order_ record. Each order is represented xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/order-change-manager/order-change-manager-json-examples-and-keys.adoc[as a JSON file].
* xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/order-change-manager/index.adoc#h2_1554146395[On the Salesforce side], the system creates an _Order Change Manager_ record for each order received from CT Mobile during synchronization.
* The system splits the received JSON and populates the _Order Change Manager_ record fields with the split JSON based on the object name.
* When a user closes the order cart, finalizes, or completes the order, the corresponding _Order Change Manager_ record is deleted.
