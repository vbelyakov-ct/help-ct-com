=== Set up CT Orders package for Dynamic Group Support

Create the required lookups:

. Create a lookup from the [.object]#Catalog# object to the
[.object]#Account# object. For example,
[.apiobject]#GroupId__c#.
. Create a lookup from the [.object]#Catalog Assignment# object
to the dynamic group object. For example,
[.apiobject]#GroupId__c#.
. Repeat steps 1—2 for the [.object]#Promotion# and
[.object]#Promotion Assignment# object if necessary.

The setup is complete.

We advise using only one lookup field to
the [.object]#Group# object on
the [.object]#Catalog#/[.object]#Promotion# object. If
the [.object]#Catalog#/[.object]#Promotion# object
contains more than one lookup to the [.object]#Group# object,
make sure to fill in all lookup fields with identical IDs.
Otherwise, the Dynamic group feature may not work correctly.

Next, set up the layouts.

. For catalogs, follow the
xref:admin-guide/workshops/workshop1-0-creating-basic-order/configuring-layout-settings-1-0/catalog-assignment-layout-setting-1-0[Catalog Assignment
Layout Setting] guide.
. For promotions, follow the
xref:admin-guide/workshops/workshop1-0-creating-basic-order/configuring-layout-settings-1-0/promotion-layout-settings-1-0#h3_950329355[Promo Assignment
Layout Settings] guide.

object and bring up created lookup to the dynamic group to the selected
layout.
