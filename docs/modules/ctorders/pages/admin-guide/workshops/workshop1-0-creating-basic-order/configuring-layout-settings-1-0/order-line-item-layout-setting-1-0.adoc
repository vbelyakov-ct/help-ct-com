= Order Line Item Layout Setting (1.0)

To create the layout for the order cart:

. Go to *Settings* and click *New*.
. In the *New Settings* window, select *Layout Setting*.
. Configure the settings as follows:
* *Record Type*: *Order*.
By default, the [.object]#CT Order# object has no record types.
If you create record types for the [.object]#CT Order# object,
you can set up different layouts for each order type. If no *Record
Type* is specified on the layout, the setting will be applied to all
order types within the _Sales Organization_ that do not have an
assigned _Layout Setting_.
* Select a *Sales Organization*. If you do not select Sales
Organization, the Order Cart layout will be applied for all orders with
no assigned Sales Organization. 
* *Parent Object*:[.apiobject]#orders__Order__c#.
* *Object: * [.apiobject]#orders__OrderLineItem__c#.
* *Fields to Display*: enter API names of fields to add to the layout
(separated by a comma, without a blank space).

[NOTE] ==== You do not need to add
[.apiobject]#orders__ProductId__c ==== and
[.apiobject]#orders__Quantity__c# fields, as they will be displayed on the layout by default.#
* Set up the *Required Attributes* and *Read-Only Attributes*
correspondingly to the fields specified in *Fields to Display*
(separated by the coma, without spaces).
