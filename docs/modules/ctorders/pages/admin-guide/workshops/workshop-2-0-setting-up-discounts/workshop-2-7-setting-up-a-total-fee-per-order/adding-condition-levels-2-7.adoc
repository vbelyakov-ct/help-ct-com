created *Condition* record under the *Conditions* section → click *New*
in the *Condition Levels* section.

. Click *Save*.

The *Condition Level* records are created. So, a 5% fee will be applied
when the total price of products in the whole order cart does not exceed
$1,000, and when the total value reaches $1,000, no fee will apply.
