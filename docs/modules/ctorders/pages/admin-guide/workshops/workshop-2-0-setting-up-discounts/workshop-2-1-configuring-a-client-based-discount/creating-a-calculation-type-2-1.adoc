= Creating a Calculation Type (2.1)

As the first step of this workshop, you need to create a _Group {plus}
Condition_ calculation type:

. Go to *Calculation Types*.
. Click *New*. The *New Calculation Type* window pops up.
. Select a *Group {plus} Condition* record type.
. Complete the form as follows:
* *Calculation Type Name*: _Client Based_
* *External ID*: _ClientBased_
* *Calculation Method*: _Decrease Price_
* *Unit of Measure*: _Percent_
* *Condition Fields Update Type*: _Real-Time_
* *Condition Fields List*: [.apiobject]#orders\__OrderId__r.orders\__AccountId__r.Name#
+
It is the API name of the field that will be used for discount calculation. You can leave this field empty, as the system will automatically update it with values from the Condition Group records created for this calculation type.
+
NOTE: The current user must have access to all the fields listed in the *Conditions Fields List*.
