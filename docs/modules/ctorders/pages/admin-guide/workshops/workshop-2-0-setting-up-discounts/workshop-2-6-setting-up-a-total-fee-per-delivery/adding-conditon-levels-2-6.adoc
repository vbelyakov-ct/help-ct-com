created *Condition* record under the *Conditions* section → click *New*
in the *Condition Levels* section.

. Click *Save*.

The _Condition Level_ records are created. So, a 5% fee will be applied
when the total price of products in a single delivery does not exceed
$100, and when the total value reaches $100, no fee will apply.
