= Creating Limit Rule for Delivery (6.2)

Let's create a _Limit Rule_ to restrict the number of products in one
delivery.

* The _Order Split_ setting created in
xref:admin-guide/workshops/workshop-5-0-implementing-additional-features/5-1-setting-up-a-delivery-split[Workshop 5.1] automatically
splits one delivery if there are products with different combinations of
families and brands.
* The _Limit Rule_ must restrict the number of products in a single
delivery based on the combinations of families and brands.



So, according to the _Order Split_ record, products with the same family
and brand will be placed in the same delivery. But according to the
_Limit Rule_ record, if the total number of such products is less than
the minimum quantity or higher than the maximum quantity, you will get a
validation error.



To create a _Limit Rule_:

. Go to the *Limit Rules* tab and click *New*.
. Select the *Delivery* record type and click *Next*.
. Enter the following:
* *Sales Organization*: _Default Sales Org_.
* *Min Quantity*: _1_.
* *Max Quantity*: _100_.
* *Order Type*: _Order_.
* *Delivery Criteria Path*: specify the _Delivery_ fields as criteria to
apply a limit rule:
[.apiobject]#Brand__c,Family__c#.

The _Limit Rule_ is created.
