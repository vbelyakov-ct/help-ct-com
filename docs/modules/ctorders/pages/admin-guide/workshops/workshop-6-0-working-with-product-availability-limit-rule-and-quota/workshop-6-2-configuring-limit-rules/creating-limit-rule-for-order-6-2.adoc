= Creating Limit Rule for Order (6.2)

Let's create a _Limit Rule_ to restrict the total price of products in
the whole order cart. This _Limit Rule_ will not interact with the
_Order Split_ setting because it checks only the total price.



To create a _Limit Rule_:

. Go to the *Limit Rules* tab and click *New*.
. Select the *Order* record type and click *Next*.
. Enter the following:
* *Sales Organization*: _Default Sales Org_.
* *Amount*: enter the field with the total price:
[.apiobject]#orders__TotalPrice__c#.
* *Min Amount*: _100_.
* *Max Amount*: _10000_.
* *Order Type*: _Order_.

. Click *Save*.

The _Limit Rule_ is created.
