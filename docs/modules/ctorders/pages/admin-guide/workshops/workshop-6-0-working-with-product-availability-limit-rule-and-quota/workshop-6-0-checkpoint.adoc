=== Allocate Quotas

To understand the Quotas flow, let's create two orders and fill them out
with the specific products to allocate quotas and calculate freebies.

Several quotes may be applied for an [.object]#Order Line Item#
based on the delivery dates. In Workshop 6.0, we use one quota for the
_Order Line Item_ record.

[[h3_2047848280]]
==== Allocate Quotas and Save the First Order

Create a basic order with the following:

. Add *DM SPOON YOG 105 CRNCH-S-CAR/plast cup*: 50 products.
. Add the *All. Bio Balance.Kefir* promotion: 2 products.
. Click *Get Freebie* and add freebies.



When you click the info icon:

|Quotas for a Product a|

_Quota_ record.

* The quota will be counted for all products added from the specified
promotion.
* If you added 2 products from the promotion and set a quantity for each
of them, the quota will be reduced by the total price of the 2 added
products, and the remaining amount is reflected in the *Remaining* line.
* In addition, in the info icon, you see the unit of measure for the
quota: amount.



image:First-Order-Quota-for-a-Promo.png[]
