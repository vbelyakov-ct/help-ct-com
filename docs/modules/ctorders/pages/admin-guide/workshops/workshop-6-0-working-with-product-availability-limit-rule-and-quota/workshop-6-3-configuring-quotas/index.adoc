= Workshop 6.3: Configuring Quotas

In Workshop 6.3, you will learn how to apply quotas in order to allow
sales reps to distribute a limited number of products available on the
required delivery dates.

. Create an individual _Quota_ record for a product.
. Create an individual _Quota_ record for a freebie.
. Create a _Quota Template_ record based on which a sales rep will share
goods from a promotion.



If you exceed the quota limit for your orders, the system will display a
validation message when you try to revalidate or finalize the order. If
you allocate quotas without finalizing orders, you can save order drafts
and see how much of the quota is already booked.

[NOTE] ==== Keep in mind that all found suitable
[.object]#Quotas ==== and [.object]#Quota Templates# will be applied to the orders. The search is done link:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/product-validation-in-order/quotas/index#h3__1386411308[in the following sequence].#
