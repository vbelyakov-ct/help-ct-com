Now, each product has the default product availability that can be
overridden or ignored depending on the product type (paid product or
freebie).

=== The Default Product Availability

the [.object]#CT Product# object has a new field that stores the
default product availability. By default, all products are available,
but you can manually change their availability, for example, for excise
products or out-of-stock goods.

. Go to *CT Products →* click the required product.
. Click *Edit* next to the *Product Availability* field and select
*NotAvailable*.

=== Ignore Freebie Availability

You can set up different availability depending on whether the product
is added from a catalog/promo or given away as a freebie—it is possible
to ignore the default product availability and Product Availability
records for a certain[.object]#Freebie Condition#:

. Go to *Freebie Types →* click the required one → open the *Related*
tab → click the required *Freebie Condition*.
. Select the *Ignore Product Availability* checkbox.

. Click *Save*.

Repeat the steps for all required freebie conditions.

=== Configure the Product Availability object

The _Product Availability_ records must be applied for a single product,
so it is necessary to relate the [.object]#Product Availability#
and [.object]#CT Product# objects.

[TIP] ==== The _Product Availability_ record can only be
assigned to a single _CT Product_ record. However, you can create
multiple _Product Availability_ records for the same product, as long as
the availability dates in those records do not overlap. ====

. Go to *Setup → Object Manager → Product Availability → Fields &
Relationships → New*.
. Create a *Product Id* field with the *Lookup* type, for example,
[.apiobject]#ProductId__c#.
. Go to *Setup → Object Manager → Product Availability → Page Layouts →
Product Availability*.
. Add the *Product Id* field to the page layout.
. Click *Save*.

The setup is complete. Now, set up availability for products and
freebies.
