include::partial$cpgpharmarequired.adoc[]

Dynamic groups help you to assign multiple accounts to catalogs and promotions and also keep records up-to-date.

Depending on the installed solution, see more information:

* xref:ctcpg:admin-guide/cpg-groups-management/index.adoc[Configuring CPG Groups]

== Create a Dynamic Group

To create a dynamic group, for example, with retail stores:

. Go to *Object Manager → CPG Group Member* or *Pharma Group Member →* click *New*.
. Follow one of the guides to create a dynamic group:
.. xref:ctpharma:admin-guide/pharma-groups-management/index.adoc#h3_1007999912[Create a Dynamic Pharma Group]
.. xref:ctcpg:admin-guide/cpg-groups-management/create-and-update-a-dynamic-cpg-group.adoc[Create a Dynamic CPG Group]

The dynamic group with the appropriate records is created.

== Set up CT Orders package for Dynamic Group Support

Create the required lookups:

. Create a lookup from the [.object]#Catalog# object to the [.object]#Account# object. For example, [.apiobject]#GroupId__c#.
. Create a lookup from the [.object]#Catalog Assignment# object to the dynamic group object. For example, [.apiobject]#GroupId__c#.
. Repeat steps 1—2 for the [.object]#Promotion# and [.object]#Promotion Assignment# object if necessary.

The setup is complete.

NOTE: We advise using only one lookup field to the [.object]#Group# object on the [.object]#Catalog#/[.object]#Promotion# object. If the [.object]#Catalog#/[.object]#Promotion# object contains more than one lookup to the [.object]#Group# object, make sure to fill in all lookup fields with identical IDs. Otherwise, the Dynamic group feature may not work correctly.

Next, set up the layouts.

. For catalogs, follow the xref:admin-guide/workshops/workshop-1-0-creating-basic-order/configuring-layout-settings-1-0/catalog-assignment-layout-setting-1-0.adoc[Catalog Assignment Layout Setting] guide.
. For promotions, follow the xref:admin-guide/workshops/workshop-1-0-creating-basic-order/configuring-layout-settings-1-0/promotion-assignment-layout-setting-1-0.adoc[Promo Assignment Layout Settings] guide.

. Create a lookup from the [.object]#Catalog# to the [.object]#CPG Group#. For example, [.apiobject]#CPG_Group__c#.
. Go to the *Page layouts* settings for the [.object]#Catalog# object and bring up created lookup to the dynamic group to the selected layout.
