= Workshop 5.3: Displaying Price Tags

The xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/order-management/price-tag.adoc[Price Tag] option is a visual display of a currently applied product discount.

To add the price tags to the layout:

. Go to **Settings **and open the existing layout for the [.object]#Order Line Item# object.
. In the *Fields to Display* field, add the [.apiobject]#PriceTag# keyword to the list of API names of fields that exist on the [.object]#Order Line Item# object (separated by a comma, without a blank space).
+
TIP: The Price Tag is always displayed after the last column in the order cart, despite the order of fields in the *Fields to Display* field.

. Click *Save*.

The setup is complete.

If set correctly, the price tags with the information about the available discounts will be displayed in the order cart next to each added product:
