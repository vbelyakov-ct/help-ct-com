= Workshop 5.1: Setting up a Delivery Split

If you want to split delivery on the same date into several by selected
criteria, create the _Order Split_ setting for this purpose.

* As a criterion, use any field on[.object]#Order Line Item# or
its parent objects that do not include in the external logic, such as
formulas, roll-up summary, process builder, and Apex.
* To use custom fields for splitting a delivery, create them on the
[.object]#Delivery# object, for example,
[.apiobject]#Brand__c#,
[.apiobject]#Warehouse__c#.



In Workshop 5.1, we create the Split Setting record to split a single
delivery in several based on the unique combination of product brand and
family.



To set up the split:

. Go to *Setup → Object Manager → Delivery → Fields & Relationships* and
click *New*.
. Create two fields:
* The[.apiobject]#Family__c# field with the *Picklist* type
that is similar to the[.apiobject]#CTCPG__Family__c#
field and has the same values.
* The[.apiobject]#Brand__c# field with the *Picklist* type
that is similar to the[.apiobject]#CTCPG__Brand__c#
field and has the same values.
. Go to the *OM Settings* tab and click *New*.
. Select the *Split Setting* record type and click *Next*.
. Enter the following:
* *Sales Organization*: _Default Sales Org_.
* *Price Book*: _Default Pricebook_.
* *Order Type*: _Order_.
* *Split Parameters Path*: add the path to the[.object]#CT
Product# fields that are used for splitting a delivery:
[.apiobject]#orders__ProductId__r.CTCPG__Brand__c,orders__ProductId__r.CTCPG__Family__c#.
[NOTE] ==== When managing bundles, make sure that the *Split
Parameter Path* value is the same for both the bundle header and its
components. Otherwise, the split settings might work incorrectly. ====
* *Split Fields*: add API names of the created custom fields on the
[.object]#Delivery# object:
[.apiobject]#Brand__c,Family__c#.

. Click *Save*.

The setup is complete.



Now, when you create an order and add products with different
combination of the brand and family, the system automatically splits a
delivery according to the _Split Setting_ record. Freebies distribution
is based on the quantity of the appropriate product, so this product and
its freebies will be added in the same delivery.

If you configured the
xref:admin-guide/workshops/workshop-5-0-implementing-additional-features/5-2-setting-up-the-delivery-summary[Delivery Summary] window,
you can view the created deliveries when clicking *Finalize* in the
order cart. The empty values on [.object]#Order Line Items# are
also considered during splitting.
