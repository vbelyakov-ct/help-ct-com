= Workshop 5.2: Setting up the Delivery Summary

The Delivery Summary window may be used to review the delivery
information and also to edit deliveries if permitted.

* To use custom fields in Delivery Summary, create them on
the [.object]#Delivery# object, for
example, [.apiobject]#Brand__c#, [.apiobject]#Warehouse__c#.
* Delivery Summary is available for both offline and online orders.



In Workshop 5.2, we create a _Layout Setting_ record to display the
Delivery Summary with the delivery date, product brand, and product
family.



To set up Delivery Summary:

. Go to *Setup → Object Manager → Delivery → Fields & Relationships* and
click *New*.
. Create two fields:
* The [.apiobject]#Family__c# field with the *Picklist* type
that is similar to
the [.apiobject]#CTCPG__Family__c# field and has the
same values.
* The [.apiobject]#Brand__c# field with the *Picklist* type
that is similar to
the [.apiobject]#CTCPG__Brand__c# field and has the same
values.
. Go to the** Settings** tab and click *New*.
. Select the** Layout Setting** record type and click *Next*.
. Enter the following:
* *Sales Organization*: _Default Sales Org_.
* *Parent Object*:[.apiobject]#orders__Order__c#.
* *Object*:[.apiobject]#orders__Delivery__c#.
* *Fields to Display*: enter API names of those fields that you want to
view in the Delivery Summary window:
[.apiobject]#orders__DeliveryDate__c,Brand__c,Family__c#.

. Click *Save*.

The setup is complete.



Now, when you create an order, add products, and click *Finalize* in the
order cart, the *Delivery Summary* window will be displayed. Review
information and click *Finalize*.

In the *Delivery Summary* window, you can edit some fields if in the
*Layout Settings* you enter false in the Read-Only Attributes for these
fields. For more information, refer to
