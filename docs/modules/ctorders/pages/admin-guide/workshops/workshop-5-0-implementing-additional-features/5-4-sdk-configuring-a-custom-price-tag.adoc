= Workshop 5.4: SDK Configuring a Custom Price Tag

Custom prices tags unlike the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/order-management/price-tag[regular ones] allow
displaying additional information on the order whether as any kind of
calculated discounts or amount of freebies.


To create a custom price tag:

. Create an HTML template that will replace the standard display of
price tags.

. Select *SDK Setting* record type and click *Next*.
. Fill in the fields:

xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/sdk-setting-field-reference[here]. ====
* Fill in *Order type* and *Sales Organization* fields.
* *SDK Type:* getOrderLineItemPriceTag.
* *Platform*: select where to apply the setting. [NOTE] ====
Currently, the setting will be not applied on mobile devices.  ====

won't be applied.

Now, when the setting is complete, you should be able to see the custom
