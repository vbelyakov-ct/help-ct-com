== Customize Mini Layout for Order Creation

The mini-layout is designed to allow the mobile user to quickly fill in the required data and check the pre-filled fields in a mini layout before opening the *Order Cart* screen.

Before setup, we recommend getting familiar with the xref:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/layout-setting-field-reference.adoc[Layout Settings] fields.

* These fields are displayed by default, cannot be removed from the layout, and will be filled if only one record fits the conditions, for example, if only one *Sales Organization* is available for the mobile user:
** *Sales Organization*
** *Order Type*
** *Price Book*
** *Account*
* If the mobile user changes *Sales Organization* or *Order Type*, the pre-filled fields, such as *Price Book* or *Pricing Procedure* (if added), are cleared.
* The mobile user can manually fill out fields with the available records.

To customize the mini-layout and add additional fields, create a new _Settings_ record with the _Layout Setting_ record type:

. Go to *Settings* and click *New*.
. In the *New Settings* window, select *Layout Setting*.
. Configure the settings as follows:
* Enter *Order* in the *Record Type* field. In the case of more than one [.object]#Order# record type, it is possible to define the different mini layouts for each record type.
+
NOTE: By default, [.object]#CT Order# has no *Record Types* and a set of *Order Types*. If you create record types, they will be hierarchically higher than the order types, and the
combination of record types and order types allows you to perform the desired business logic.
* Select a *Sales Organization*.
* *Object*: [.apiobject]#orders\__Order__c#.
* *Fields to display*: API names of fields to add to the layout (separated by a comma, without a blank space).
* If you want to make the additional field compulsory, enter _True_ in the *Required Attributes* field.
+
image:adding-ct-orders-to-the-ct-mobile-app-2020-12-23.png[]
. Click *Save*.
. xref:ctmobile:ios/mobile-application/synchronization/synchronization-launch/index.adoc#h3_1369866827[Launch full synchronization].

The setup is complete.

So, when the mobile user taps the *Order* button, he selects the _Order_ record type (if created), fills out the mini layout, and taps *Create*. Next, the *Order Cart* screen appears, where the mobile user adds products, specifies deliveries and manages freebies.

NOTE: The *Create* button is active when all data is validated.

. In the *Available* section, drag-and-drop, for example, *CT Price Book* in the *Selected* section.
+
