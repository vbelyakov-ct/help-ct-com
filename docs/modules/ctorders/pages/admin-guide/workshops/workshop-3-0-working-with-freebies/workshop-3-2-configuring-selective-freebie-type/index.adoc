= Workshop 3.2: Configuring Selective Freebie Type

In Workshop 3.2, you will learn how to distribute freebies based on all matched conditions. In this workshop:

. Create the _Freebie Type_ to apply all matched conditions.
. Create a _Freebie Condition_ that distributes certain products when the required number of promotional products are added to the order cart.
. Set up the *Delivery Control* option for each condition, which determines the first or last delivery to give away freebies.

If certain conditions are met, in the Freebie window:

* _Freebies_ will be automatically distributed (and unmatched cells will be blocked), or you should manually add freebies up to the minimum required number.
* The Freebie window interface will update depending on which condition is triggered.
