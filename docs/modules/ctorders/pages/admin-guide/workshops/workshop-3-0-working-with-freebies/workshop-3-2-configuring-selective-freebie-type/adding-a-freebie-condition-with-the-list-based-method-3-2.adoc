= Adding a Freebie Condition with the List Based Method (3.2)

Set the conditions to determine how freebies should be shared in the order based on the added products.

* One condition is to distribute certain freebies in the first delivery when the minimum number of required promotional products are added to the order cart.
* Products that will be distributed as freebies must be separate related records.

To create a priority _Freebie Condition_ record:

. Go to the created _Freebie Type_ record → click the *Related* tab → click *New* in the *Freebie Condition* section.
. Enter the following:
* *Freebie Condition Name*: _All. Bio Balance.Kefir_.
* *Delivery Control*: select _First_ to share freebies in the first delivery.
* *Order*: _1_.
+
TIP: The field is responsible for the order in which _Freebie Conditions_ of _Freebie Type_ are applied. Since we only use one _Freebie Condition_ in the workshop, you can specify any value in this field.
* Select a *Promotion* for which you are creating a condition. Promotion is required for the correct distribution of freebies for the _Selective_ freebie type.
* Set *Active*.
* *Condition Details*: add this JSON, according to which the condition will trigger for the certain promotion product if the required number of such products is added to the order cart.
