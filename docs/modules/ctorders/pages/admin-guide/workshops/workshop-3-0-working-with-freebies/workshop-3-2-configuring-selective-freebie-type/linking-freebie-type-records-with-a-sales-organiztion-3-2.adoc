= Linking Freebie Type Records with a Sales Organization (3.2)

After you created the required _Freebie Types_, link them to your _Sales
Organization_.

[WARNING] ==== Only one selective and one prioritized _Freebie
Type_ records can be simultaneously used for one _Sales Organization_.
The records must not interact with each other because conditions of both
types will be applied at once. If you try to link two records of the
same _Freebie Type_ to a _Sales Organization_, you receive an error.
