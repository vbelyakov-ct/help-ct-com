= Creating Freebie Line Items (3.2)

Products that will be distributed as freebies must be separate related
_Freebie Line Item_ records.



To create _Freebie Line Item_ records:

. Open the *All. Bio Balance.Kefir* freebie condition â†’ go to the
*Related* tab and click *New* under the *Freebie Line Item* section.
. Select a product you intend to grant as a freebie for certain
promotion products added to the order cart.

If you can't see the list of available products in the *Product* field,
you might need to manually change the standard page layout of the
_Freebie Line Item_ object: display the
link:admin-guide/getting-started/setting-up-an-instance/configuring-object-setting[lookup field to the CT Product
object] instead of the default lookup field.
