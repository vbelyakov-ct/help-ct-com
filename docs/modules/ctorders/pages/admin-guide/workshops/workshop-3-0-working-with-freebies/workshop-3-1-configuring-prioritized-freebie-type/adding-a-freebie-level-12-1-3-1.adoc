= Adding a Freebie Level (12+1) (3.1)

To apply a[.object]#Freebie Condition#, it is necessary to
create freebie level(s).

* In this workshop, we set up two[.object]#Freebie Levels# for
the second[.object]#Freebie Condition#.
* We will give 1 freebie for each added 12 products.
* The minimum number of products in the order to distribute freebies is
10.
* The minimum number of distributed freebies is 2.
* The maximum number of distributed freebies is 10.



So, according to these settings, you should distribute at least 2
freebies and a maximum of 10 freebies since at least 10 products are
added to the order cart:

* If there are 10 products, then we distribute 2 freebies.
* If there are 12 products, then we distribute 2 freebies.
* If there are 24 products, then we distribute 2 freebies according to
the ratio.
* If there are 36 products, we distribute 3 freebies.
* And so on, but taking into account that the maximum quantity for
distributing is 10 freebies.
