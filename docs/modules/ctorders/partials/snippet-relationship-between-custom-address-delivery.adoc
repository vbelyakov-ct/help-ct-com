= Snippet: Relationship between Custom Address &amp; Delivery

Create a lookup from the [.object]#Delivery# object to the
custom [.object]#Address# object. By default, there is only the
lookup from the [.object]#Delivery# object to
the [.object]#Account# object, which means delivery will be
carried out at the address specified in
the [.object]#Account# records.



To create a lookup for the[.object]#Delivery# object:

. Go to *Setup → Object Manager → Delivery → Fields and Relationships*
and click *New*.
. Select the *Lookup Relationship* data type for the new custom field
and click *Next*.
. Select the *Address* object from the *Related to* picklist and click
*Next*.
. In the *Field Information* section:
* Enter the *Field Label*.
* Enter *Field Name*.

[TIP] ==== It is recommended to use the following API name:
[.apiobject]#AddressId__c ==== or
[.apiobject]#Address__c#. #
*  Enter a *Child Relationship Name* for integration purposes:
_Deliveries_.
