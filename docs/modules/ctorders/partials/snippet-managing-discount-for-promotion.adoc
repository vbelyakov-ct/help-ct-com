The current setup signifies that you need to add at least 10 items of each of the three products in the *Promo Products* list to get a discount for all products in the order cart, except the [.object]#Promotion Line Items# you checked as *Excluded From Discount*. The more the amount of ordered *Promo Products*, the bigger the discount rate for the order.
