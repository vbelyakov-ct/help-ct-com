= Snippet: Custom Address Object

To use a custom[.object]#Address# object as the
[.object]#Address# object:

. Create a custom[.object]#Address# object with the *Address*
field(s) of the _Text_ data type, for example,
[.apiobject]#CustomAddress__c#.
. Create an _OM Settings_ record with the _Object Setting_ record type
and specify the API name of the custom[.object]#Address#
object.
. Create an _OM Settings_ record with the _Address Setting_ record type
and specify the corresponding *Address* field, for example,
[.apiobject]#CustomAddress__c#.

a lookup] from the[.object]#Delivery# object to the custom
[.object]#Address# object.
. Create a lookup from the custom[.object]#Address# object on
the[.object]#Account# object.



After you created the custom[.object]#Address# object and
field(s), relate delivery addresses to the required _Sales Organization_
record by creating the _Settings_ record with the
link:admin-guide/managing-ct-orders/sales-organization-management/settings-and-sales-organization-data-model/settings-fields-reference/address-setting-field-reference[Address Setting] record type.

. Go to *Settings* and click *New*.
. In the *New Settings* window, select the *Address Setting* record
type.
. Configure the setting as follows:
* In the *Sales Organization* field, select the Sales Organization if
required.

[TIP] ==== If you create the setting from the *Sales
Organization* page, the *Sales Organization* record will be already
specified. ====
* In the *Address Field*, enter the API name of the *Address* field on
the[.object]#Account# object.
* In *SOQL Filter*, specify the SOQL query to sort delivery addresses
given the selected _Account_ record.

Filter example:



This query will be considered by the system as:



where:
**[.apiobject]#orders__Address__c# is the address
object you specified in the _Object Settings_.
**[.apiobject]#ParentId# is the API name of the lookup from
_Address_ to _Account_.
**[.apiobject]#'{!Account.Id}'# is a keyword that is
replaced with the ID of the _Account_ for which the order is created.
