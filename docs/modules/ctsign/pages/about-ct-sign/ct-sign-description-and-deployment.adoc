CT Sign is provided as two connected components:

. The CT Sign managed package.
. The Application Service, also known as the CT Sign app, is intended to
connect with the e-signature provider.
. * The native CT Mobile app for iOS and Windows with added CT Sign
module.
+
[NOTE]
====
CT Mobile Android does not support the CT Sign
module.
====
. * An e-signature provider.
+
[NOTE]
====
CT Mobile Windows does not support the integration
with e-signature providers.

document being signed.
* The custom fields of the standard
xref:ref-guide/ct-sign-custom-settings-and-objects/content-version-field-reference.adoc[Content Version] object are intended to store the attributes of the templates for documents being signed and to send them as document parameters.
* The generated documents are saved as link:https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=collab_salesforce_files_parent.htm&type=5[files] to allow users to attach the same document to different records. Until a transaction (a _Sign Document_ record) receives a successful completion status, the document is attached only to this transaction. Next, the document is additionally attached to the record from which the signing
process was started.
* The *Signing Contact* field is used as a link between _Account_ and _Contact_ who should sign the generated document.

=== Custom Setting

* The protected xref:ref-guide/ct-sign-custom-settings-and-objects/sign-credentials.adoc[Sign Credentials] custom setting is intended to store the Application Service credentials. To
fill out the custom setting, the system uses the custom web service. Users have no access to this custom setting.

== Application Service and e-Signature Provider

Users can add handwritten signatures to a document without additional integration.

To use a legally binding e-signature, connect the Salesforce organization with the installed CT Sign package, the Application Service, and the e-signature provider.

* Application Service, provided by the Customertimes team, is used as a third-party service to connect your Salesforce org or CT Mobile app with an e-signature provider for sending and receiving transactions and signed documents.
* As the e-signature provider, each customer should link:https://developers.docusign.com/platform/building-integration/[prepare the DocuSign account] to connect with the Application Service and Salesforce organization.
. Create the developer account with the configured DocuSign app and the enabled DocuSign
Connect xref:admin-guide/connect-salesforce-with-the-application-service-and-e-signature-provider.adoc[to test the e-signature process].
. xref:admin-guide/connect-salesforce-with-the-application-service-and-e-signature-provider.adoc[Obtain the production account] and go live with the DocuSign app to allow the legally binding signing.

== Deployment Steps

Users may sign documents with legally binding or simple signatures in Salesforce and on a mobile device. Depending on the purpose and the platform of a mobile device, skip the unnecessary steps, for example, if there is no need to give iOS users the ability to sign documents with a legally binding signature.
