=== Salesforce Table

Salesforce table allows displaying values from the fields of the related object. The rows of the table are filled out with the *Value* word during the editing of a template and replaced with real value while forming a document. If the related field of the object's record is empty, the marker will be replaced with a blank space.

Use the Salesforce table to display Salesforce data in a document for signing according to the specified conditions.

. Click the Salesforce table image:Salesforce-Table.png[] icon.
. Fill in the information:
* Define *Columns*, *Width* and *Height*, and the size of the outside *Borders*.
* Define the space between cells in *Cell spacing* and a cell height in *Cell padding*.
* Define the *Alignment* of the text in the table.
* Add the table name in the *Caption*.
* Add a description in the *Summary*. The description will not be shown in a template.
* Select the object from which the values will be added to the table.
. On the *Salesforce Table Properties* tab:
* In the *objectCondition* field, enter a SOQL filter to display only eligible records of the selected child object.
* In the *showCondition* field, enter a SOQL filter to display the Salesforce table only on the matched records of the parent object.
. Click *OK*. The table is added to the template.
. To define fields that will be displayed in the Salesforce table, click the *Source* button and edit the HTML code. For example, to define 3 headers (_Delivery Date_, _Address_, _Total Price_), insert the following code:
+
[source,html]
----
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" child-table="orders__Delivery__c" objectcondition="SELECT orders__DeliveryDate__c, Address__c, orders__TotalPrice__c FROM orders__Delivery__c" style="width:500px;" summary="delivery-table">
<caption>Delivery</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">Delivery Date</th>
<th scope="col">Address</th>
<th scope="col">Total Price</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>
----

+
As a result, you will get the following:
+
image:ctsign-table-headers.png[]
. Click *OK*.

The Salesforce table is set.

Here are some examples:

* SOQL filter to output the template only to the matching contacts of the parent _Organization_ record.
+
[source,html]
----
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" child-table="orders_OrderLineItem_c" class="forcetable" id="forcetable-6"&nbsp;objectCondition="SELECT Name, FirstName FROM Contact WHERE AccountId = '{!MainObjectId}'">
----
* SOQL filter to display the table only on matching _Visit_ records.
+
[source,html]
----
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" child-table="orders_OrderLineItem_c" class="forcetable" id="forcetable-6"&nbsp;showCondition="FROM RetailVisitKpi WHERE AssessmentTaskId.TaskType = 'PlanogramCheck' AND ParentId = '{!Visit.Id}'">
