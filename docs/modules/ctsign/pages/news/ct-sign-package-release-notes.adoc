[[h2_644677997]]
== The CT Sign package v. 1.29 '23

[[h3_1117270046]]
=== Fixes

* Previously, if at least one of the templates had a related [.object]#ContentVersion# object record with specific package fields set to null, the list of available templates was empty (even templates, which are properly set, were not displayed). Now, templates with undefined fields are not displayed, and templates with proper settings are displayed in the list.

=== New Features and Improvements

xref:admin-guide/create-a-new-template.adoc[Templates]:

* The _No Auth_ option is added for the *Authorization Type* of the *Signature* button when using the *DocuSign* sign type. If specified, no confirmation will be required during the signing process.

[[h3_1014887477]]
=== Fixes

* Previously, during the signing, it was impossible to select a template, for which no record type is specified. Now, such template will be available for all object record types and can be selected.
* Some read-only attributes, specified on the xref:admin-guide/configuring-the-ct-sign-package/index.adoc#h2_283394407[Form Document layout], were available for editing. Now, all read-only attributes cannot be edited during the signing process.
* Some required attributes, specified on the xref:admin-guide/configuring-the-ct-sign-package/index.adoc#h2_283394407[Form Document layout], could be ignored during the signing process. Now, all required attributes must be filled out to complete the signing process.
* Fixed displaying date and time on the generated PDF document instead of just date.
* The *Save Draft* button has been removed from the *Form Document* page, because it does not launch any action.
