== Add Sign Document object as a Related List to a Custom Object

You can view and share signed documents on the custom object records in the xref:admin-guide/sign-a-document-the-ct-mobile-app/add-the-ct-sign-to-the-ct-mobile-app.adoc[CT mobile application]. To do that, add the xref:ref-guide/ct-sign-custom-settings-and-objects/sign-document-field-reference.adoc[Sign Document] object as a related list to a custom object.

For example, to work with signed documents in CT Orders records, create a lookup relationship between [.apiobject]#orders\__Order__c# and [.apiobject]#ctsign\__SignDocument__c# objects. After that, you will see the *Sign Documents * tab in the CT Orders records and will be able to share the documents. Please note that:

* Documents signed by _Simple Sign_ will be available for sharing immediately.
* Documents signed by DocuSign online will be available after performing the
link:https://help.customertimes.com/smart/project-ct-mobile-en/synchronization-launch[fast synchronization].
* Documents signed by DocuSign offline will be available:
* In Salesforce: as soon as all signatories sign the document.
* In the mobile application: after all signatories sign the document and after performing the link:https://help.customertimes.com/smart/project-ct-mobile-en/synchronization-launch[fast synchronization].
