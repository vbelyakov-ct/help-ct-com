=== Handle Offline Flow

If there is no internet connection when a user signs a document, the request and the corresponding _Sign Document_ record will be saved on the device and sent to Salesforce via the next synchronization.

. The [.apiobject]#Batch_DocumentSender# Apex class runs every 15 minutes and sends the corresponding request and record to Application Service to complete the signing. For versions 1.22 and later, the Apex job may not launch. To fix it:
.. Remove the Apex job from the schedule:
... Go to *Setup* → *Environments* → *Jobs* → *Scheduled Jobs*.
... Find the *Batch_DocumentSender* job.
... Click *Del* to remove it and click *OK* to confirm.
.. link:https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.code_schedule_batch_apex.htm&type=5[Schedule the Apex job manually]:

ctsign.Schedule_BatchDocumentSender schbatchDocumentSender = new ctsign.Schedule_BatchDocumentSender();
System.schedule('Batch_DocumentSender started at 0 minutes of the hour', '0 0 * * * ?', schbatchDocumentSender);
System.schedule('Batch_DocumentSender started at 15 minutes of the hour', '0 15 * * * ?', schbatchDocumentSender);
System.schedule('Batch_DocumentSender started at 30 minutes of the hour', '0 30 * * * ?', schbatchDocumentSender);
System.schedule('Batch_DocumentSender started at 45 minutes of the hour', '0 45 * * * ?', schbatchDocumentSender);
----
. Signatories receive the email from DocuSign to complete signing, even if the *Device* option is selected in the *Signatory Place* field for the *Signature* button.
. The final document will be attached to the corresponding _Sign Document_ record.
. The _Sign Document_ record with the final PDF will be linked to the record that started the signing process.
* If the parent record has not been synced yet, launch the synchronization to send the record to Salesforce and link it to the parent record.
* If the parent recording has been synced, no additional sync is required.

[[h3_294308259]]
=== Handle Online Flow

When a user has signed a document in the CT Mobile app, the status of the _Sign Document_ record will change to *Completed on Device*. Given the status, the [.apiobject]#SignDocumentProcess# trigger will fire to attach the final document to the _Sign Document_ record.

[[h3_1634586017]]
=== Handle Errors

If any errors occur on the records described above, the sync process will include link:https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/sync-recovery[the Sync Recovery functionality].

. If an error occurs while sending the _Sign Document_ record (or any of the records that it refers to via reference fields), then the _Sign Document_ record will be sent with the help of the link:https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/sync-recovery/a/h3_459631233[Direct access] option.
. The related _ContentVersion_ record will be sent as usual via synchronization.

. If records in steps 1 or 3 could not be sent via the *Direct access* option, the CT Mobile app tries to send them using the link:https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/sync-recovery/a/h3_356910769[Proxy object] option.

[[h2__1032724594]]
== Document Storage

When a user signs a document, a _ContentVersion_ record and the _ContentDocumentLink_ record are created. These records and the _ContentDocument_ record represent a _File_ that links to the _Sign Document_ record.

* _ContentDocument_ is the information about the file and a link to the latest published version. The _ContentDocument_ record is automatically created on the Salesforce side when the _ContentVersion_ record is inserted.

* xref:ref-guide/ct-sign-custom-settings-and-objects/content-version-field-reference.adoc[ContentVersion] is the content of the file in the base64 format and the template attributes.
* _ContentDocumentLink_ stores the link between the _ContentDocument_ and the record to which this file is attached.
