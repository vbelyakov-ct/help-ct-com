==== Handle Offline Flow

If there is no internet connection when a user signs a document, the
request and the corresponding _Sign Document_ record will be saved on
the device and sent to Salesforce via the next synchronization.

. The[.apiobject]#Batch_DocumentSender# Apex class runs
every 15 minutes and sends the corresponding request and record to
Application Service to complete the signing. For versions 1.22 and
later, the Apex job may not launch. To fix it:
.. Remove the Apex job from the schedule:
... Go to *Setup
* → *Environments* → *Jobs* → *Scheduled Jobs*.
... Find the *Batch_DocumentSender
* job.
... Click *Del
* to remove it and click *OK* to confirm. 
.. https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.code_schedule_batch_apex.htm&type=5[Schedule
the Apex job manually]:
. Signatories receive the email from DocuSign to complete signing, even
if the *Device
* option is selected in the *Signatory Place* field for
the *Signature
* button.
. The final document will be attached to the corresponding _Sign
Document_ record.
. The _Sign Document_ record with the final PDF will be linked to the
record that started the signing process.
* If the parent record has not been synced yet, launch the
synchronization to send the record to Salesforce and link it to the
parent record.
* If the parent recording has been synced, no additional sync is
required.

[[h3_294308259]]
==== Handle Online Flow

When a user has signed a document in the CT Mobile app, the status of
the _Sign Document_ record will change to *Completed on Device*. Given
the status, the[.apiobject]#SignDocumentProcess# trigger will
fire to attach the final document to the _Sign Document_ record.

[[h3_1634586017]]
==== Handle Errors

If any errors occur on the records described above, the sync process
will include
https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/sync-recovery[the
Sync Recovery functionality].

. If an error occurs while sending the _Sign Document_ record (or any of
the records that it refers to via reference fields), then the _Sign
Document_ record will be sent with the help of the
https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/sync-recovery/a/h3_459631233[Direct
access] option.
. The related _ContentVersion_ record will be sent as usual via
synchronization.
. The _ContentDocumentLink_ record, which is linked to the _Sign
Document_ record, will be sent with the help of the *Direct access*
option.
. If records in steps 1 or 3 could not be sent via the *Direct access*
option, the CT Mobile app tries to send them using the
https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/sync-recovery/a/h3_356910769[Proxy
object] option. If unsuccessful, a corresponding error will be listed on
the
https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/errors-screen[Errors]
screen.

[[h2__1032724594]]
=== Document Storage

When a user signs a document, a _ContentVersion_ record and the
_ContentDocumentLink_ record are created. These records and the
_ContentDocument_ record represent a _File_ that links to the _Sign
Document_ record.

* _ContentDocument_ is the information about the file and a link to the
latest published version. The _ContentDocument_ record is automatically
created on the Salesforce side when the _ContentVersion_ record is
inserted.
* link:content-version-field-reference[ContentVersion] is the
content of the file in the base64 format and the template attributes.
* _ContentDocumentLink_ stores the link between the _ContentDocument_
and the record to which this file is attached.
