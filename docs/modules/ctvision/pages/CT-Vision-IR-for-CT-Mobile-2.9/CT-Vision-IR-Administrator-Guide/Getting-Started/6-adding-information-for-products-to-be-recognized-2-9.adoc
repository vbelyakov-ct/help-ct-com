= 6. Adding Information for Products to be Recognized
:toc:

To recognize products in photos taken, train the provider's neural networks by uploading marketing photos of the product to the CT Vision server. You also can use these photos in link:https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/custom-related-lists[custom related lists] in the CT Mobile app or add them to catalogs and orders for the link:https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-orders-3-0/ct-orders-solution[CT Orders] solution.

== Adding and Viewing Product Photos in Salesforce 

When you added all required products to your Salesforce org, upload marketing photos and additional information about the product to the CT Vision server. The [.object]#Product Image# object is intended to store all required information for recognition of photos by the selected provider in one place. For more information, refer to xref:CT-Vision-IR-for-CT-Mobile-2.9/CT-Vision-IR-Reference-Guide/product-image-field-reference-2-9.adoc[Product Image Field Reference]. To upload and view marketing photos of products, add the following sections on the desired Product Lightning page layout:

* Add *Product Image Uploader* for uploading a product image or providing a URL-address to it.
* Add *Product Image Viewer* for viewing marketing photos with additional product information specified in the [.object]#Product# fields and statuses of recognition of training provider or Einstein model.

To edit the [.object]#Product# Lightning page layout:

. Go to *Setup → Object Manager →* the desired [.object]#Product# object →  *Lightning Record Pages*.
. Click on the desired record layout name.
. Click *Edit* on the record details page.
. In the *Lightning App Builder*, drag the *Product Image Uploader* and *Product Image Viewer* sections from the components tab on the left to the record page layout.

. Click *Save*.

The setup is complete. On the corresponding *Product* record, you can upload new photos or change them.

For example, if a product has a packaging change, the administrator manually replaces a photo with a new one. Next, <<h2__518870114, if customized>>, a process sends updated records from Salesforce to the provider. The provider will process product images on a separate endpoint for training, and then a new version of the product design can be used to recognize the product on the shelves.

== Setting up Product Image Uploads 

To use product images to recognize products in the taken photos, set up uploading them to the CT Vision server:

. On the [.object]#Product Image# object, create a field with the *Lookup* type to link it with the corresponding [.object]#Product# object.
. Go to *Setup → Custom Code → Apex Triggers →* check that the [.apiobject]#ProductImageProcess# and [.apiobject]#Product2VisionProcess# triggers are active.
. Go to *Setup → Custom Code → Custom Settings* → click *Manage* next to *Trigger Settings* of the CT Mobile package (*Namespase Prefix* is *clm*).
. Click *New*:
.. In the *Name* field, specify [.apiobject]#Product2VisionProcess#.
.. Select *Active*.
. Click *Save*.

The setup is complete. Marketing photos will be stored on a server side and,
<<h2__1751244368, if customized>>, displayed for the *Product* record tab.

=== Filtering Products to Upload Their Images

Specify the criteria to send product images only of the required products. To set the criteria:

. Make sure, that the  *Product Synchronization Criteria*  field is added on the  *Vision Setup*  page layout for the xref:CT-Vision-IR-for-CT-Mobile-2.9/CT-Vision-IR-Reference-Guide/vision-setup-field-reference-2-9.adoc[Vision Setup] custom metadata type.
. Go to *Setup → Custom Code → Custom Metadata Types →* click *Manage
Records* next to *Vision Setup*.

. Click *Save*.

The setup is complete.

== Testing Image Recognition 

Optionally, you can test the loading and recognition of photos before setting up the integration with the CT Mobile app. Add the following sections on the desired [.object]#Activity# Lightning page layout:

* *CT Vision: Photo Uploader* is designed for uploading images of shelves with the desired products to the CT Vision server.
* *CT Vision: Photo Carousel* is designed to recognize products in uploaded images.
