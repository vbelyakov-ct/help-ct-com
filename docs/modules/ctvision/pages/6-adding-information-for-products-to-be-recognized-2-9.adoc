To recognize products in photos taken, train the provider's neural
networks by uploading marketing photos of the product to the CT Vision
server. You also can use these photos
in https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/custom-related-lists[custom
related lists] in the CT Mobile app or add them to catalogs and orders
for
the https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-orders-3-0/ct-orders-solution[CT

== Adding and Viewing Product Photos in Salesforce 

When you added all required products to your Salesforce org, upload
marketing photos and additional information about the product to the CT
Vision server. The Product Image object is intended to store all
required information for recognition of photos by the selected provider
in one place. 



For more information, refer
to link:product-image-field-reference-2-9.html[Product Image Field
Reference].



To upload and view marketing photos of products, add the following
sections on the desired Product Lightning page layout:

* Add *Product Image Uploader* for uploading a product image or
providing a URL-address to it.
* Add *Product Image Viewer* for viewing marketing photos with
additional product information specified in the Product fields and
statuses of recognition of training provider or Einstein model.
To specify the additional product information, refer to
link:3-specifying-product-objects-and-fields-2-9.html#h2__2130197288[Specifying
Product Objects and Fields: Product Image Information].



To edit the Product Lightning page layout:

1.  Go to *Setup → Object Manager →* the desired Product
object → *Lightning Record Pages*.
2.  Click on the desired record layout name.
3.  Click *Edit* on the record details page.
4.  In the *Lightning App Builder*, drag the *Product Image Uploader*
and *Product Image Viewer* sections from the components tab on the left
to the record page layout.

5.  Click *Save*.

The setup is complete. On the corresponding *Product* record, you can
upload new photos or change them.



For example, if a product has a packaging change, the administrator
manually replaces a photo with a new one. Next,
link:6-adding-information-for-products-to-be-recognized-2-9.html#h2__518870114[if
customized], a process sends updated records from Salesforce to the
provider. The provider will process product images on a separate
endpoint for training, and then a new version of the product design can
be used to recognize the product on the shelves.

== Setting up Product Image Uploads

uploading them to the CT Vision server: 

1.  On the Product Image object, create a field with the *Lookup* type
to link it with the corresponding Product object.
2.  Go to *Setup → Custom Code → Apex Triggers →* check that
the ProductImageProcess and Product2VisionProcess triggers are active.
3.  Go to *Setup → Custom Code → Custom Settings* → click *Manage* next
to *Trigger Settings* of the CT Mobile package (*Namespase Prefix* is
*clm*).
4.  Click *New*:
1.  In the *Name* field, specify Product2VisionProcess.
2.  Select *Active*.
5.  Click *Save*.

The setup is complete. Marketing photos will be stored on a server side
and,

=== Filtering Products to Upload Their Images

Specify the criteria to send product images only of the required
products. To set the criteria:

1.  Make sure, that the **Product Synchronization Criteria** field is
added on the **Vision Setup** page layout for
the link:vision-setup-field-reference-2-9.html[Vision Setup] custom
metadata type. 
2.  Go to *Setup → Custom Code → Custom Metadata Types →* click *Manage
Records* next to *Vision Setup*.

5.  Click *Save*.

The setup is complete.

== Testing Image Recognition 

Optionally, you can test the loading and recognition of photos before
setting up the integration with the CT Mobile app. Add the following
sections on the desired Activity__ __Lightning page layout: 

* *CT Vision: Photo Uploader* is designed for uploading images of
shelves with the desired products to the CT Vision server.
* *CT Vision: Photo Carousel* is designed to recognize products in
uploaded images.
