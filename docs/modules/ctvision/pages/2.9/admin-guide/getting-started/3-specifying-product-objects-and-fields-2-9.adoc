= 3. Specifying Product Objects and Fields
:toc:

Specify the product fields to send their values for processing and storing on the server.

Go to the *CT Vision* app and open the *CT Vision Setup* tab.

[NOTE]
====
Before the first entry to the *CT Vision Setup* tab, go to xref:ctmobile:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-tools/index.adoc#h3_2011978[CT Mobile Control Panel: Tools] / xref:ctmobile:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-tools-new.adoc#h2_2011978[CT Mobile Control Panel 2.0: Tools] tab and check that the cloud token is added. Currently, the cloud token may be stored in two custom settings, and the CT Vision IR retrieves it based on the combination of the CT Mobile package version and the used CT Mobile app version. For more information, refer to the xref:ctmobile:ios/getting-started/installing-ct-mobile-package/ct-mobile-managed-package-update-to-v-3-54.adoc[CT Mobile Managed Package Update to v. 3.54] description.

. Allow Salesforce to create a field with the *Lookup* type when prompted for the specified [.object]#Product# object.

The setup is complete. The field with the *Lookup* type will be automatically created on the [.object]#Product Image# object to relate it with the specified [.object]#Product# object.

Check the user profile permissions to make sure the newly created lookup is available for all required users:
