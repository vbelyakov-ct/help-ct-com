For the correct CT Vision IR work, valid Image Recognition Service
Provider credentials and necessary information must be specified in your
Salesforce org. There can be multiple providers, and they can be
assigned to the specific group of _Users_, _Accounts_, or any object
that has a *Lookup* type field to associate with a
specific Activity object.



Go to the CT Vision app and open the *CT Vision Setup* tab.
