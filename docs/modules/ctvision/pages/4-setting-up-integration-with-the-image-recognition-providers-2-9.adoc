= 4. Setting up Integration with the Image Recognition Providers

For the correct CT Vision IR work, valid Image Recognition Service
Provider credentials and necessary information must be specified in your
Salesforce org. There can be multiple providers, and they can be
assigned to the specific group of _Users_, _Accounts_, or any object
that has a *Lookup* type field to associate with a
corresponding value for the image recognition provider.

The list of available providers in the *Recognition Engine* picklist:

* CG Cloud Einstein. This provider is used in case of integration
with https://help.customertimes.com/articles/ct-mobile-ios-en/cg-cloud[the
CG Cloud solution].
* CT Vision
* EasyPicky
* Einstein
* Intelligence Retail
* Planorama
* https://help.customertimes.com/smart/project-ct-vision-lite-en/about-ct-vision-lite[Vision
Light]. Select this provider when image recognition is not required.

The setup is complete.
