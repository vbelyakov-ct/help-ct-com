Permissions* options appear on the right side of the screen.

to create and delete records of the offline object.
* This permission will not affect the ability to create or delete a
record of the current object in the *Related Lists* section of another
offline object. For example, if you restricted the creation of
a *Contact* record in the *Object Permission* section, you may allow
creating the *Contact* records in the *Related Lists* section of
the [.object]#Account# object. * Since CT Mobile 2.5, users can delete unsynchronized records if they have permission to create records but not delete them. 3. In the *Related Lists* section: * Select the record type of the offline object from the drop-down list of record types available for the user profile. * Use toggles to grant permission to create and delete records of the standard related lists. 4.
