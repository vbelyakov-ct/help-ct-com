Create the MobileId__c field on the required Activity object in order to
identify whether a record has been created on a mobile device or in
Salesforce. Photos taken on a mobile device will be attached only to the
records with the specified Mobile Id, and the taken photos will be
stored on a mobile device up to 7 days.

== JSON Web Token 

Photos taken in CT Mobile using the CT Vision IR module are sent to the
server for recognition. To connect to the server, the CT Mobile app
sends that pair of the Salesforce Org Id in the 18-digit format and the
valid cloud token to the server, and the server generates a JSON Web
token.

* The JSON Web token is used each time the CT Mobile app connects to the
server. If the JSON Web token is not received or is invalid, photos will
not be sent to the server.
* The generated JSON Web Token lifetime is 1 year.
