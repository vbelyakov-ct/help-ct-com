= Vision Info Field Reference

The _Vision Info_ record type is responsible for viewing the product
details when
xref:2.8/admin-guide/working-with-ct-vision-in-the-ct-mobile-app.adoc#h3_2072273480[the clickable realogram is active].

When the mobile user taps the recognized photo on a shelf, the product details with the product preview are displayed. The product previews are stored in the same folder as the xref:../product-image-field-reference.adoc[Product Images] records (if they exist) on the server.

* When xref:2.8/admin-guide/getting-started/specifying-product-objects-and-fields.adoc#h2_1362989108[the Product Code value] has been changed, Salesforce rebuilds the archive with the _Product Images_ records.
* CT Mobile downloads the archive during the first or full synchronization.
* If the archive has been rebuilt, CT Mobile downloads it during the next synchronization.
* If the archive is still the same since the first or full synchronization, CT Mobile will not download it.
