== Cloud Token

To download all required CT Vision IR objects and apply the CT Vision IR module logic, go to xref:ctmobile:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel/ct-mobile-control-panel-tools/index.adoc#h3_2011978[CT Mobile Control Panel:Tools] / xref:ctmobile:ios/admin-guide/ct-mobile-control-panel-new/ct-mobile-control-panel-tools-new.adoc#h2_2011978[CT Mobile Control Panel 2.0: Tools] tab and check that the cloud token is added.

Currently, the cloud token may be stored in two custom settings, and the CT Vision IR retrieves it based on the combination of the CT Mobile package version and the used CT Mobile app version. For more information, refer to the xref:ctmobile:ios/getting-started/installing-ct-mobile-package/ct-mobile-managed-package-update-to-v-3-54.adoc[CT Mobile Managed Package Update to v. 3.54] description.
