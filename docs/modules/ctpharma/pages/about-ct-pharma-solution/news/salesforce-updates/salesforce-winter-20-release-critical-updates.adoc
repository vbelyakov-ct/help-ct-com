Salesforce has announced two critical updates to be released at the
beginning of 2020. The administrator of the CT Pharma package must
perform additional configuration for the current profiles before the
update is released, otherwise the CT Pharma package proper functioning
will be impossible.

|Require Customize Application permission for direct read access to
custom settings a|
Currently users without Customize Application permission can read custom
settings using different APIs that are provided by Salesforce. Following
the "secure by default" approach, read access for users without
Customize Application permission will be revoked with this update.

System Administrator needs to perform the actions that are described in
this article to allow access to custom settings to non-admin CT Pharma
users (via profiles or permission sets).

|Require Customize Application permission for direct read access to
custom metadata types a|
Currently users without Customize Application permission can read
unprotected custom metadata types using different APIs that are provided
by Salesforce. Following the "secure by default" approach, read access
for users without Customize Application permission will be revoked with
this update.

System Administrator needs to perform the actions that are described in
this article to explicitly grant access to custom metadata types to
non-admin CT Pharma users (via profiles or permission sets).

You can allow direct read access to Custom Settings and Custom Metadata
Type by editing:

* Profile settings
* Permission Set settings.

For the first option, you will need to configure each profile
separately, or you can edit a permission set and assign it to all users
you want to grant read access to.

[NOTE] ==== After updating the permissions configuration,
