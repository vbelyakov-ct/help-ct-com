= Override Basic Actions for Activity

Overriding a standard button changes what happens when a user clicks on  it.

To launch the *Activity Report* Visualforce page instead of having a standard Salesforce page, you should override the *New*, *Edit*, and *View* buttons.

To override the *Edit* button:

. Go to *Setup*(1) → *Object Manager* → *Pharma Activity*(2) → *Buttons, Links and Actions *(3).
. Click *Edit *(4) next to the *Edit* label.

. In the *Override Properties* section, next to *Salesforce Classic Override*, select *Visualforce page* → `ActivityReport [CTPHARMA__ActivityReport]` and click *Save*.

The *Edit* button is overridden.

Repeat these steps to override the *New* and *View* buttons.
