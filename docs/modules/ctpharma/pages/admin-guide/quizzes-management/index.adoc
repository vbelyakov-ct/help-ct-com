== Quiz Model

Each _Quiz_ record has a number of related _Quiz Question_ records. The passed _Quiz_ is stored as the _Quiz Completion_ record with the linked _Quiz Answer_ records. The corresponding _Quiz Answer_ record is related to the _Quiz Partaker_ record. The administrator assigns _Quiz Partakers_ by creating a _Quiz Partaker_ record.

== Configuring Quizzes

Quizzes may be used for the following purposes:

Estimate your representatives by restricting the time of a quiz and setting a passing score.

Collect the targeted doctors' feedback to improve the representative and doctor relationship.
