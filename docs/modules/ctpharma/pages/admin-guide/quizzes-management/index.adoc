about CT Products, which are targeted at doctors and hospitals, and to
get feedback about the representative's daily routine. For example, how
they conduct a meeting, what they like or do not like, how much time
they spend on visits, etc.

representative visited.

=== Quiz Model

Each _Quiz_ record has a number of related _Quiz Question_ records. The
passed _Quiz_ is stored as the _Quiz Completion_ record with the
linked _Quiz Answer_ records. The corresponding _Quiz Answer_ record is
related to the _Quiz Partaker_ record. The administrator assigns _Quiz
Partakers_ by creating a _Quiz Partaker_ record.
