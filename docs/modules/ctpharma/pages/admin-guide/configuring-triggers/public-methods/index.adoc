= Public Methods

Public means the method can be used by any Apex in this application or
namespace. As other class methods, a public method can be called by
triggers and other classes.
Calling methods of other classes enables code reuse, reduces the size of
your triggers, and improves maintenance of your Apex code. It also
allows you to use object-oriented programming.

You can extend a class to provide more specialized behavior. A class
that extends another class inherits all the methods and properties of
the extended class. In addition, the extending class can override the
existing virtual methods by using the override keyword in the method
definition. Overriding a virtual method allows you to provide a
different implementation for an existing method. This means that the
behavior of a particular method is different based on the object youâ€™re
calling it on.

Currently, we have only one public method in the  package:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
global virtual void createRelatedData(List<__Activity__c> activityList,Map<Id, __Activity__c> oldMap) {
code_block
}
----

* The global class is `G``lobalActivityService`.
* The first parameter is the list of records of __Activity__c_.
* The second parameter is the previous values of records of
__Activity__c_.



Here is an example of how to extend the existing class and override its
public method:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
public class ClassName extends GlobalActivityService {
public override void createRelatedData(List<__Activity__c> activityList, Map<Id, __Activity__c> oldMap) {
your_code_block
} 
}   
----
