= Enabling the ByPass Logic

The _Bypass Logic_ functionality is intended to restrict the execution of one or several trigger methods by deactivating the specific trigger context(s) or methods.

To restrict execution of a method invoked by the trigger context:

. Go to *Setup* (1) → *Custom Code* (2) → *Custom Settings* (3).
. Click *Manage* (4) next to *Trigger Settings*.

[TIP]
====
If you updated the CT Pharma package, some triggers will not be added to the *Trigger
Settings* list. xref:admin-guide/configuring-triggers/index.adoc[Add a record] with the specific CT Pharma trigger name.
====
. In the *Bypass Logic* field, specify the trigger contexts or methods that should not be invoked. For example: [.apiobject]#ai,bd# (where ai stands for [.apiobject]#after insert# and [.apiobject]#bd# stands for [.apiobject]#before delete#) or [.apiobject]#au_createRD# (where [.apiobject]#au# stands for [.apiobject]#after update# and [.apiobject]#createRD# stands for [.apiobject]#createRelatedData#).
+
[TIP]
====
In order to disable the logic of creating _Activity_ objects' records (either for standard or custom _Activity_ objects), for *ActivityProcess* trigger specify [.apiobject]#createRelatedActivities# in the *Bypass logic* field.
====
. Select the *Active* checkbox.
. Click *Save*.
