= Activity Sync Default Configuration

By default, the following field values are copied via Activity Sync:


[cols="^,^,^",]
|===
|*Standard Calendar* | |*CT Pharma Calendar*
|*Field Label* |*Field Label* |*Field Name*
|Event |Task |CTPHARMA\__Activity__c
|StartDateTime |- |CTPHARMA\__StartDate__c
|EndDateTime |- |CTPHARMA\__EndDate__c
|WhoId |WhoId |CTPHARMA\__ContactId__c
|WhatId |WhatId |CTPHARMA\__AccountId__c
|OwnerId |OwnerId |OwnerId
|===


When the activity record is generated, the relationship
field [.apiobject]#CTPHARMA\__ActivityId__c# on the
standard[.object]#Activity# object record is filled-out. Due to
this relationship, the changes are synchronized.



Only the field changes from the table above will be taken into Account
during synchronization, if:

* the standard and custom activity records are already synced;
* the type of record on the custom Activity or the value of the *Type*
field on the _Task_/_Event_ record is changed.
