= Configuring Activity Sync

Use Activity Sync to:

* Automatically synchronize the standard and custom
[.object]#Activity# objects' records.
** Generate a record of the standard[.object]#Activity#
object when creating entries for the custom Activity object in one-way
or both-way synchronization.
** If you have a few Activity Sync settings, make sure that active
settings are not crossed with each other. It can cause failures in
creating a record according to these settings.
* Synchronize changes in the record.
* Map configuration of additional fields that are required to update
when synchronizing.
** Use *Fields to update* and *Fields values* for mapping additional
fields.
** Some field values synchronize automatically, and there is no need to
add them to a new Activity Sync record. Check these field values here.

=== Set Up Task and Event

For the correct operation of Activity Sync, the *Type* field should be
specified on the [.object]#Event# and[.object]#Task#
objects as well as the *EventProcess* and *TaskProcess* settings in
Trigger Settings.

[NOTE] ==== If you create a new Activity Sync setting with
the *Standard* or** Custom object record criteria**, the *Type* field
will not affect Activity Sync.
====

By default, the *Type* field is absent on the page layout of the
standard[.object]#Event# and[.object]#Task# objects.
Add this field to the objects.

. Configure page layouts of the standard *Event* and *Task* fields.
Go to *Setup* → *Object Manager* → select *Event / Task* → *Page
Layout*. Add the *Type* field to the page layout.
. xref:user-permission-settings[Check profile permissions] to the
*Type* field. A profile should have
the __View __and __Edit __permissions to the *Type* field.
Go to **Setup → Users → Profiles → **select profile → go to
the **Field-Level Security **section and click **View **next to **Task
→ **add _Read_ and _Edit_ access to the** Type** field.
. Configure *Global Quick Actions* on the *Account* and *Contact*
tabs.
Go to *Setup* → *User Interface* → *Global Actions* →
click *Layout* next to *New Event / New task* → add the *Type* field to
the layout.


Next, add the _EventProcess_ and _TaskProcess_ settings in Trigger
Settings.

. Go to *Setup* → *Custom Code* → *Custom Settings*.
. Click *Manage* next to *Trigger Settings*.
. Click *New* and create two settings.
For the first one:
* Enter *EventProcess* in the *Name* field.
* Set a flag next to the *Active*.
* Click *Save & New*.

For the second one:
* Enter *TaskProcess* in the *Name* field.
* Set a flag next to the *Active*.
* Click *Save*.

The Trigger Settings are specified.

[NOTE] ==== Check that the _ActivityProcess_ setting is active
in Trigger Settings. If not, create or edit it and then set a flag next
to *Active*. ====

=== Create Activity Sync

To create an Activity Sync:

. Go to *Setup* (1) → *Custom Metadata Types* → *Activity Sync* (2).
. Click *Manage Records* (3) next to *Activity Sync*.
image:58829173.png[]
The *Activity Sync* page opens.
You can also click **Activity Sync **and then click *Manage Activity
Sync *(3)** **on the *Activity Sync* page.
image:58829174.png[]
. Click *New* (4) to create a new Activity Sync.
image:58829176.png[]
The *Activity Sync Edit* page opens.
. Fill in the required fields.
. Click *Save*.

Activity Sync is created.

=== One-way Synchronization

Here is an example of one-way synchronization with additional field
mapping.
When a standard[.object]#Event# object with a value of
_Meeting_ in the *Type* field is created, an entry of the custom
[.object]#Activity# object with the type of the _Pharma Event_
record is created. Additionally, the value of the *Description* field
from the _Event_ record is copied to the _Activity_ entry record in the
*Description* field.

[[h2_605908405]]
=== Both-Way Synchronization

Here is an example of both-way synchronization using the *Standard
Activity Type* field.
When creating a record of a standard[.object]#Task# object with
the value of _Meeting_ in the *Type* field, an entry of the batch
[.object]#Activity# object with the type of the _Visit_ record
is created. Similarly, when you create an _Activity_ record with the
_Visit_ record type, a[.object]#Task# object record with the
value of _Meeting_ in the *Type* field is created.

image:58829234.png[]
Here is an example of both-way synchronization using
[.object]#Standard# and[.object]#Custom# object record
criteria.
When a standard[.object]#Event# object with the specific
_Subject_ name is created, an entry of the custom
[.object]#Activity# object with the type of the _Visit_ record
is created. Similarly, when you create an _Activity_ record with the
_Visit_ record type and the specific _Status_, an
[.object]#Event# object record is created.
