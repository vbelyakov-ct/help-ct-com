== Group Types

The limit is equal to 500 thousand records per group. If there are more records, a warning is displayed.

[[h3_1554410513]]
=== Static Group

A static group is a snapshot of records per specific time. It can be used to send ad hoc emails such as:

* announcements;
* invitations to the events;
* special offers of products;
* etc.

[[h3_1007999912]]
=== Dynamic Group

Use dynamic groups to keep the lists of record per different objects up to date, e.g.:

* to create a group of users for the onboarding process;
* to create a group of clients who meet specific criteria, for example, were not visited during the last 2 weeks but have orders for more than $100 000;
* to derive the list of the most popular products based on product sales or numeric distribution;
* etc.

== SOQL Builder to Filter Pharma Group Records

SOQL Builder is used for creating a SOQL query to filter records in a Pharma group.

. On a high level, set up a query based on the parent object.
. Add up to a maximum of two subqueries applied to children's records if needed.

WARNING: We do not recommend to use different fields with the same names in the SOQL queries. The reason is that Dynamic SOQL in the Managed Package uses the default package field and ignores the field with the same name, but with the package prefix.

The SOQL builder buttons:

* Click image:62558834.png[25,25] to add criteria based on the fields of the object's record;
* Click image:62558835.png[28,115] to add criteria in the brackets;
* Click image:62558838.png[28,119] to add criteria based on the fields of the child object record;
* Click image:62558844.png[28,119] to launch validation of the query.
