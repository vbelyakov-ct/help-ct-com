== Update a Dynamic Pharma Group

To update a dynamic group, you can choose between recalculation per record, dependent on the Apex trigger activation, or scheduling recalculation manually.

[[h3_1694404096]]
=== Recalculation per Record

If a user creates, updates, or removes a record of the object that matches the criteria of the dynamic group, the xref:admin-guide/configuring-triggers/ct-pharma-triggers/group-member-process.adoc[GroupMemberProcess] trigger immediately recalculates the dynamic group. It checks specific fields of the record and updates the corresponding dynamic group(s).

Object records will not be recalculated if only the records of the child objects have been changed.

[[h3_1746193321]]
=== Schedule Recalculation

By default, the dynamic groups are updated daily. The special Apex [.apiobject]#Schedule_DynamicGroup# class will be run to update all the dynamic groups according to all the criteria for each parent and child objects.

Manually added group members cannot be recalculated. To recalculate this record, unchecked the *Manual* field.
